0,The best stay with amazing facilities and service. The staff is very helpful and friendly! It has really good hands on staff for any help or problem. My family totally loves this place. Hope to visit again after the pandemic.
1,"We had booked the night stay to celebrate birthday of our little princess, which turned out to be lifetime memorable, as they had upgraded us to Presidential suite for our comfort and also made special arrangements to make our day special. We and our guests had a luxurious day!   Suite was very spacious and elegant with mesmerising view, Buffet meals at Lotus cafe were mouth watering with huge variety of dishes. Hospitality extended by the staff, made us feel at home.  Would like to convey our special thanks to Ms.Rashmi ( Guest Relations ), Mr. Satish ( F&B ) Mr. Sohaib ( Duty manager ), Ms. Amen and Mr.Rohit Tiwari ( Manager ) for making all the required arrangements.  Looking forward to visit again and again!!"
2,JW Marriott or Marriott is always the best choice. We had a Birthday celebration and they upgraded our room to the best one. Staff is always courteous. It‚Äôs all their training. Breakfast is good but lunch and dinner are better. We are Marriott members since a long time and we will always continue to choose this brand for our stay. Cheers
3,Its expensive but they take good care of you. Rooms are cleaned everyday and the staff is warm and welcoming . My stay was great and everything seemed to be focussed on customer satisfaction and luxury. Will visit again.
4,"For a short stay, JWM Juhu offered a great city retreat. Food, service and room quality exceeded my expectations, but most importantly the warmth of the hotel staff made coming out of lockdown absolutely delightful."
5,"Having locked at home for 8 months, it was time to step out. But being pregnant and traveling with a 6 yr old daughter was a challenge.. Yet we needed a break from all the stressful days managing work and home on our own.. We didn't want to travel outside Mumbai and having heard of stayacations offerings from various hotels around we decided to go for this safest option.. After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever.."
6,The worst service ever for a 5 star hotel they don't pick your phone up or clean your room.they kept my call waiting for 10 minutes and still didn't clean my room after I came back after 2-3 hours this is the worst hotel I have ever been to.
7,"Being 9 months pregnant, safety and comfort was prime for my anniversary staycation. JW Marriott staff went beyond expectations to ensure that all my requirements with regards to safety, check-in process etc were completely taken care of. Especially the check-in process, of which I had heard horror stories from guests of other 5 star hotels, with JW Marriott it was a cake-walk, again all thanks to the staff. Here I would like to especially call out Ms. Rashmi Trivedi, who guided me right from before check-in to the check-out process, ensuring that our small staycation was the best. I have not experienced this level of personal touch and hospitality even in Bali resorts! Secondly also a thanks to Radhika from front desk for making our check in process so swift. The buffet"
8,It was an excellent experience that we had at the JW which is undoubtedly one of the best properties in town. The staff was really supportive and made sure that we get each and every thing that we want at our disposal. Had a lot of fun hereüòÄ
9,It was a fabulous stay of 8 days with top notch hospitality. Yuvraj was very helpful and cooperative with everything that we required and asked for. The food was great and the stay was fabulous along with great service.
10,"After nine long months staying at home we finally decided to start with a staycation again. And, m glad we chose jwmarriot juhu. Beautiful property at the beach. Every staff of the hotel took all necessary precautions. like masks, sanitizers...through out our stay. Rooms were spot less. Very comfy bed and pillows. Good quality sleep.  We got an ocean view club room. Room has all the amenities. Spacious room, perfect for us (two adults one toddler). Our package includes buffet breakfast, high tea and a dinner. Plus, we had a sunday brunch too. Huge spread, as sunday brunch should be. Fresh seafood, salads, live stations, dessert station, cold cuts, sushi, fresh juices... Nd much much more. Their indian section was quite impressive coz, instead of just regular curries there were"
11,"During the COVID times where we dint have the place to do our online festival , jw made it possible For us I don‚Äôt think any other hotel would be possible to do it . Thank you for all the service what you guys have given to us specially taking care of our safety for more than 9 days. We have not even faced a single problem, we would love to associate with you guys in the future and we would like to thank mr Srikant from sales , Akshay from sales too and mr yuvraj from f&b, Abhsihek from front office . Specially thank you to these people ."
12,"I would like to thank Mr.Yuvraj from F N B, who really took care of our event and he was at service whenever we called him. His hospitality was wonderful and I would like to wish him all the very best for his future. We would also like to thank Jw Mariott Mumbai for having us here and helping us to close this event and make this event a grand success. We would like to be associated with the hotel in future too for our other social events"
13,"Amazing experience at jw mumbai. We were here for a week for an event. Nice food and ambience.. we thank mr akshay shetty from sales who who helped us in  every detailing of this event.  Regards, Rishabh Jain"
14,Amazing experience. Very cooperative staffüòç Nice food and ambience.. one of the finest properties of mumbai and we would like to thank Mr. Shrikant from sales who helped us making this event a grand success.
15,"Overlooking the beach we had a near perfect room. Safety precautions were excellent, meals were good particularly the breakfast. Cannot forget the walk on the beach and the sunset view. Staff was courteous and helpful."
16,"All team members of JW are much more helpful than expected.perticularly NELINI mam and RAshmi mam, we truly appreciate and respect your help and hospitality beyond Evan JW.will keep in mind the same personally."
17,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The check in and check out were quick. The room was good. The walk to the suite from the elevator is really long. However the view is breathtaking and worth the walk. Access to the beach from the hotel is only from 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. Room service was good. Housekeeping asked us when he can clean the room, we asked him to come at 5pm when we would be away but he never turned up. The windows in the room had fingerprints from the previous guests. Although you cannot use the pool, which is ok considering covid, was not clean.  The breakfast spread was good and we enjoyed it. Being a BonVoy member, we understand the cleanliness standards set by Marriott and that is why we chose this property. Unfortunately this was a let down. I hope the management can"
18,"I stayed at this hotel with my family for my Diwali holidays. Unaware fully of my booked room (Studio Suite Room) being so small, I was not given an upgrade although through my Marriott Bonvoy membership or even on a chargeable basis with the excuse that rooms are not available! The Room was so small that it was not having Office Table & Chair and instead a Dining Table for 2 was there. To place an extra bed in the room, we need to remove this Dining Table! I felt that monopoly attitude which I felt few years back is not changed till the time and even in tough time for hospitality industry. Except selected room, F&B dept. was good & staff was courteous. Especially, Gurvinder Vilkhu from F&B and Rashmi from the Front Office were very much courteous."
19,"Been dining at lotus cafe these past few months.All covid precautions in place.  As always the staff polite and efficient. Restaurant manager Mr.Ritesh , Mr.Siddesh..very welcoming. Rebecca Ronny...Akash...super efficient. The best dish Nalli Nihari  (  tender  meat) cooked by chef Mr.Sirajjudin is delicious full of flavour and lip smacking ! The best in town !  Thankyou ....you have  great talent chef ! And we always enjoy a relaxing meal here."
20,"I stayed at jw Marriott juhu recently had gone for a wedding that could not be avoided overall it was a socially distant wedding.. .. & the hotel staff was very nice ,all the safety precautions were takenby the hotel ...   however the 22nd morning breakfast there was a buffet breakfast & so many people sharing the same spoon for filling their plates came as a shock to me... and it was immensely crowded I was shocked to see the morning breakfast venue it looked like a normal day (not covid time) the hotel was booked to what looked like almost full capacity as it was buzzing with crowd.the stay overall was nice but i was disappointed seeing the breakfast venue with such a large crowd eating together , the hotel  could have done something about it and not kept a buffet or different"
21,"Due to travel restriction we could not travel but I wanted my 10th Wedding Anniversary to be special, so I booked best hotel in town JW Marriott Juhu. Even being in busy city like Mumbai it gives a feel of a resort. Location is perfect with a beach view. I booked Executive ocean beach and the vie from room was just amazing. I am seeing Juhu beach since my childhood but never thought it would be so beautiful. You have 360 view of beach from all rooms. View from bathroom from bathtub is just spectacular.  Please convey my thanks to Rashmi Trivedi to make this special occasion so memorable. All arrangements were perfect. All requests were taken care in time.   Also would like to thank Satish from Lotus Cafe, he was really very helpful and made sure to accept all our special"
22,"Today was my 3rd visit at JW juhu as this is my preferred Buisness destination for all my meets. How lovely it is to be warmly greeted by Jessica, she is very dedicated and passionate about her duty and also remembers potential guest like me. It feels special to be recognised as one, Highly recommended to visit JW juhu."
23,"During Covid when most 5 star properties are putting their best foot forward in terms of care, service and attention to detail, this hotel has gone the opposite route. If you want to make a booking you have 2 choices: call or website. In India government offices get discredited with bad customer service but I think this hotel can single handedly top that experience. You can call on any number and either no one responds or they pass your call to another department where again no one responds even after 15 minute waiting time. If you try booking online, their site crashes on every page. Their insta handle bio's link also crashes, I mean at least save your marketing dollars.  Finally when someone decides to take the call, the response is to get back in 2 days which again does not"
24,"Had an amazing mini vacation during our stay at the hotel. The hotel took precautions and the staff was very hygienic. Sanitization stations were present almost everywhere in the lobby and the rooms were well sanitized too which makes this a safe place to stay during COVID. Dinner service at the Lotus Cafe went smooth with such a diverse menu for the buffet. Thanks to Ritesh, Satish and Gurvinder for an amazing service as they were on their toes whenever needed. The room service was great, as the staff cooperated really well. We got to visit the beach in the morning and with a complementary breakfast we had our bellies full. A big thanks to Nallini from Guest relations who ensured our stay was hassle free."
25,I have  visited j w Marriott Juhu Mumbai on 14h to 17th with my family we had two sea views rooms I found everything to 5 star quality as expected. Thanks to Rashmi and Abhishaik Sing our stay memorable and comfortable in corona virus fear we enjoyed every corner and facilities available one that blocked was for our safety and gov guidelines. I have stayed numbers of times and will return because I would not take chance as I did in past to regret. I love it food cleanness safety hygiene service you name it I will give ten... Thank you Rashmi Abhishaik Sing and many more at JW.

30,"I'd like to compliment the outstanding service of the staff. Starting with the warm welcome & help of the front desk. Rachira & Saif are kind, friendly & patient. Also Amen is warm & welcoming. The tall young man who works late night in helping with my TV & cable problem was so patient & friendly. Roshan who's kind, helpfulness & friendly voice on at your service makes me feel comfortable to call for assistance.  And Parag in the lovely buffet restaurant. Excellent staff! Thank you!"
31,"Production put me here while I was working on a show.  The hotel is beautiful and it's in a great location. Staff is super nice and the breakfast is unparalleled. However, do not book the house care. They charged me 2k rupees for a 15 minute ride and took way to long to sort out.  Plus I double confirmed the driver knew where to go.  I finally got in the car and he didn't know. I was late for my meeting and they overcharged me. Forrest essential toiletries in the bathroom. The hair dryer was the best hotel hair dryer I've used anywhere in the world."
32,"As we still cannot celebrate the birthday with friends or relatives we have stayed in Marriott for a day  On my Daughter‚Äôs 14 th birthday .If I had to Describe  experience in one word it was ‚ÄúMarvellous ‚Äú  A huge bunch of surprises were planned for us .. on our check in as  a service gesture we were upgraded to a suit .. which was huge with  breathtaking view.   My Daughter was welcome with a beautiful cake , cupcake n donuts...of amazing Taste .  Food ..service and Ambience was awesome.   I sincerely wana thanks  Rashmi , Radhika Jagtap , Nellini  Gomes and entire staff of Marriott for making my daughter D Day so memorable ."
33,"We had a staycation for 2 nights at J W Marriott Juhu and the stay was absolutely amazing. To start with we were upgraded to a suite and hotel staff followed strict social distancing guidelines. We were welcomed very well by Giridhar and that felt v good. My 2 daughters had an amazing time at the hotel as they were engaged in many activties (Pizza making, fish feeding, cup cake decoration). Amen, guest services manager took super care for my daughters.  We also had great evening meals and there was good care in terms of wearing masks,  social distancing. Many J W staff including Chef took special care. To mention some names, Anil Chef Alok, Check Nakul all took extra care.   The over hospitality was right at the top. The room was beautiful and luxurious. Care taken by hotel"
34,"Went with family for dinner after 6 months to J.W Marriott, Juhu. The place was nice done up keeping in mind social distancing, staff was very polite and extremely helpful. . Tough much variety was not available in buffet, service was good. The staff made sure they were there to cater to our needs as self serving was not allowed to avoid any kind of contact of infected person. . Temperature was taken at enterance and hands sanitized."
35,"Hi   The stay was amazing and memorable, with the Marriott hospitality,  We would specially like to thank your team Member Radhika Jagtap for hosting a perfect stay and upgrade . Truly 5 * values  Appreciated  Regards  Hirani family ."
36,"Took some time off from pandemic‚Äông  - by spending some quality time at the JW Marriott Juhu, Mumbai! Felt nice to feel experience legendary Marriott hospitality while being safe; working away while being nestled beach side, is not what one expects from Mumbai -  considering its much famous maximum city reputation!   The team at the JW Juhu was top class. Special shout out to Ms. Trivedi at Guest Relations & all of the folks in F&B !  F"
37,Well staying here was definitely the best decision we made we had such an amazing stay all safety protocols were followed  We even had a toddler with us we were definitely skeptical  about leaving our homes n staying in a hotel but it was a good decision at the end.
38,"Awesome view with amenities one could ask/dream of. Had a great time with the infrastructure, hospitality of certain people like Abhishek, Rashmi who added a different flavor altogether during this stay. Looking forward to stay more and recommend the same to my near and dear ones for sure."
39,"This was the first staycation booked after the whole COVID 19 lockdown and safe to say it surpassed all our expectations! Before check in the team reached out and highlighted the safety protocol in place with all the procedures clearly laid out making things very smooth when we checked in and checked out. They were kind enough to upgrade us to the Grand Ocean Suite! Staff was so kind and attentive. Literally the most memorable stay we‚Äôve had.  The suite was impeccable, clean, sanitised and hygienic.  Just over all a fantastic wholesome experience!"
40,"Being a 5 star you obviously have a certain level of expectation from the hotel. JW Marriott went above and beyond to ensure we have a splendid staycation. Their location is their biggest position of strength, however, it‚Äôs the interior architecture that adds to the charm. Despite COVID, they had an elaborate buffet experience without maximum safety measures in place - something no other hotel is providing at the moment. Plus they were supremely supportive in creating a special experience for my husband‚Äôs birthday. To summarise, can‚Äôt wait to stay with them once again!"
41,"I stayed at JW Juhu in October 2020. Despite being apprehensive about how hotels are coping, with the coronavirus, I took a chance and made my reservation for a relaxing break away from work from home and house work :)   From the time I entered the lobby till I excited the lobby the following day, it was a very smooth and comforting experience. The staff are working extra-hard to ensure all precautions and protocol are being undertaken and followed diligently.  Hats off to the staff for serving us with smiles and warmth even during such trying times.   Signages across the lobby and elevators as well as the guest room floor are easy to understand, and I hope all guests follow it for their own and others' sake.   The breakfast buffet was held at Lotus Cafe, which had recently for"
42,We had a great time at weekend at the hotel. The floor team with Rashmi. The staff at restaurant for meals - Gurvinder. Exec chef alok and team. Thanks for giving us a fantastic stay and service during our stay.   Rooms also fab.
43,"After spending full eight months at home with no where to go and scared of every place, this visit was a great relaxing time as every sanitation and precaution was taken care of.  With limited crowd you could really feel safe.  Excellent staff, available at at time you call for.  A special thanks for the Dinning staff at Lotus Cafe, especially Mr.Ritesh who single handedly took care of every person and we could really feel his warmth in the room.  Ms. Lidia & Guest Relations Ms. Laxmi, made my grandchildren feel so good every time we visited the place.  Besides the above two each and every staff including the Chef were very sweet and polite, my special thanks to each one of you.  The room service given by Mr. Arvind  was just excellent.    Inroom Dinning service provided by Ms."
44,It was amazing stay ..everthing was so perfact..we would like to visit again .and all managment ..staff services was excellent.and specially Thanks to Raees..he has done a great job for meüòä..Tysm for everything..
45,"We visited for few days. The hotel was not that crowded due to COVID. But the entire team at JW ensured our safety and comfort. Right from check-in, rooms cleanliness, food  we were well taken care of. All areas well kept clean and sanitized which made us feel safe. A BIG thank you to entire team at JW Marriott, Juhu to make our family stay comfortable."
46,"My family had a wonderful stay at Jw Marriott, Juhu. The location , the staff, food everything made our stay so pleasant . Even though we were at quarantine there was no compromise on the food , everyday the menu was different and everything was copacetic. I am glad I chose Jw Marriott for my stay .  Thankyou."
47,"Yes we made a blunder, by choosing this property over Taj/ Regis and booked this hotel for some change in scenery and activity. 2 days of some pathetic hospitality that we would be happy to forget as thats what the staff at JW juhu did, they convincingly shirked and left us all by ourself be it room cleaning or ordering sanitizers in room.The hotel was definitely  empty with hardly some footfall which made it easier for us to understand how they actually run.  Starting with the only positive:  the seamless booking experience with JW and thanks to Karan for the same.  The entire team( reception, at your service, in room dining) which in my experience, was inharmonious, hubristic and uncivil, and to my belief could be the worst traits to have when you're in the hospitality"
48,Wanted to thank entire staff of Juhu JW MARRIOTT for giving wonderful stay to my family. Special thanks to Mr Rohit and Mr Abhishek for giving lovely room and giving the best cooperation in my one day stay. Keep up the good work. My special thanks to Mr Shrikant also in lotus cafe for giving wonderful dining experience.  Thank you once again Mr Rohit and team. Juhu Marriott is always class apart experience.
49,During the on going pandemic we were looking for a safe place for a quick getaway with our child. Glad we chose J.W Marriott as it was not just safe but the staff was extremely caring too...!   The food served was excellent and Sanitization was ensured from the moment we entered the premises.
50,We ordered from Marriot on Wheels..the food was delivered at the promised time and the food was lip smacking! Absolutely delicious.. the bell boy was also very courteous when they had delivered the order
51,"We had ordered food @ home delivery. Tastewise, the food was super, especially the indian variety. Paneer starters, moong dal halwa and Gulab jamun are especially worthy of mention! The non veg fare, especially chicken and gosht kebabs were fantastic! Keep it up JWM!"
52,"I ordered the weekend lunch from JW Marriott at Juhu, Mumbai through their JW on Wheels menu and I must say that the service, quality and quantity of food was impeccable! Courteous staff and excellent service! Mr. Ritesh Gupta ensured that the order was fulfilled to my complete satisfaction. Thank you JW Marriott for a scrumptious meal!"
53,"Great hotel, had been there for a weekend this month. very understaff and every thing took a lot of time.  covid safety was not taken care off, was shocked to see in buffet every guest was pick up food using the same cutlery.  virus transmission can easily happen.   1) evening tea and cold coffee took 45 mins 2) had call for beer and papad in room. beer took 40 mins and they forgot to get papad. by the time papad came beer was over. 3) had to wait for 1 hour for gate to open for beach excess, in the end i was tired waiting and could go to beach. 4)lunch pizza came on time was very cold, could not eat even a slice. salad and staters came after pizza.   5) had confrimed late check out but bell boys came 2 times to pick the bag up at 12 and 12.30  had a great stay in past but this"
54,Awesome lockdown stress buster with full family...  Free room upgrade.. Lovely tasty breakfast dinner package with staycation offer..  Beach üèñ access was special feature where after enjoying beach bath u can get cleaned in hotel with open shower and towels  Special thanks to miss Nailiniji for arranging lovely well personalised surprise cake with guitar on cake for my child birthday and child activities   All lotus cafe staff took so much personal care forgot the names mr.amit joginder and 3-4 more staff   It was a real stress buster.   Only CRONES  SWIMMING pools closed by govt still  SPA closed Beach Acess only 8-10am & 5-7am
55,"I have been staying at this hotel for the past 7 months during the lockdown, at the Grand Ocean Suite &  enjoying the Juhu beach view everyday with the different shades of the sky and the sea. Hotel has a beautiful garden and a big pool area which is a good relaxing/walking space where I unwind my day with the fishes and the birds. I  can easily say this is the best hotel to stay for everyone in Mumbai for this timeline.   Their handling of the pandemic situation has been exceptional. The number of safety precautions they take for every guest with the presence of the hotel doctors, along with the high standards of hygiene & the thoughtfulness of every staff helps me & other guests stay safe & calm.   For all of this experience, I would like to thank the captain of the ship Mr."
56,"Amazing service!! Even with reduced staff.  Nikhil is great with customer service. He notices rash guests and is very friendly. Darpan , a great bartender.  Makes good drinks with and without alcohol.  Overall amazing service, good food, nice staff. Kudos"
57,"Visited Mumbai on 20th Aug 2020 for a 3 day vacation and this was worth every risk amid the pandemic. Let me start by saying that JW Marriott Juhu, is well prepared to take care of all guests needs and exceeds expectations by maintaining all hygiene, sanitation and social distancing norms. At no point did we feel like we were being unnecessarily exposed to other guests or staff. We felt really safe and taken care of. Above all that, the service at the all day dining restaurant and room service was excellent. All thanks to Deependra, Ritesh and Satish for the surprisingly good mocktails they offered and helping us with the menus in all meals. Chef Alok and Chef Nakul were amazing and spoiled us with excellent meals, from Italian to Oriental to Japanese. The room was impeccable"
58,It was a awesome stay and humble staff. Awesome Breakfast in morning All the Safety taken by the Staff . Awesome Support by Mr Raees for reservations. Also Radhika mam helped us to do some activity for children which also amazing
59,"Excellent selection of starters & main course. The food was very well packed too and delivered right on time.  We ordered for the Indian meal and the food was delectable with variety on office.  The accompanying sweet (gulab jamun) could have been different, better.  In all , very satiating meal."
60,"So, I turned 40 on 30th aug.. I had great plans of going with my family overseas but due to the pandemic it all went to drain.. under no circumstances I wanted to stay at home so I googled and the next best thing I saw was JW Mariott opening its gates for stay.. so I googled their number and spoke with Raes and he was such a helpful soul he told me all about the precautions JW takes .. I was a bit worried as I have a 4.5 year old son .. but he assured me.. gave me an upgrade and Ofcourse ensured that I get a  lovely sea facing room.. the room was a delight..! From the moment we entered Marriott such good care was taken.. from a seamless check-in to taking us to our rooms to ensuring all safety measures were explained .. we knew we were in safe hands ..  the meals were delicious"
61,"JW Marriott has always been on the excellence side of the service and they delight you every time. Tried their Mariott on Wheels for the 2nd time today. What a superb service by Satish who makes sure that the order reaches as required(with Customisations) on time. During COVID every small joy matters and MoW brings a bundle of joy in form of super tasty food...be it Fusion Roots pizza, Mutton Seekh, Chicken Biryani,  Ravioli and my all time fav Brownies... Simply Yummylicious...! Also, they deliver it themselves with full precaution in terms of driving their own 4ws, staffs as delivery guys with all necessary care taken. JW Marriott,Juhu - Thanks for the care and delight you bring to us every time we take a bite!   Kudos to Satish and JW Marriott Juhu team... the guy who got the"

63,"We went in for a staycation at JW Juhu, as we did not want to take the risk of traveling out of Mumbai. And I just have one line to say after the experience at JW. So, what if it is COVID? We had a fantabulous stay with a lot of love and care from every member of the wonderful staff at the hotel. Radhika was just wonderful - the children loved the fun activities that she used to arrange for them. Gurvinder and the wonderful person (missed getting his name) from the restaurant who used to patiently serve us almost every meal during our 5 day stay there, how can we forget the wonderful mocktails and allied surprises that you would bring our way? In fact, every team member at the restaurant was wonderful. The safety standards in these difficult times was impeccable and extremely"
64,The dinner Ordered was not upto  the mark and I spoke to chef Alok and others . They went above and beyond to make up . Not only did they resend a delicious meal but added a few things on their own . Thank you so much for taking care and making it up so beautifully!

78,"We visited J.W. Marriott, Juhu for a weekend Staycation last week. Special Thanks to Abhishek And his team for upgrading us to an ocean view suite. Great hospitality with all safety measures being followed.One of the best Breakfasts We‚Äôve had in a long time.  All photos and updates of our stay on @your_vacation_goals on Instagram."
79,I Kumar Srivatsa from Abundantia Entertainment having been ordering for  both Veg & Non Veg food for our guest Mr Ashok G . He is extremely satisfied with the food but only requests for few more items in veg to be added if possible .  We are extremely satisfied with the delivery also which is right in time . Thank you
80,"Thru out the lock down, we have had the most amazing food and service by The Marriot Hotel. The food and the precautions have been really good. Karishma Vaid has been personally servicing & looking into the orders. The delivery person comes in the hotel car. I feel safe about their hygiene and service and have even gifted cakes to friends and family via marriot on wheels.  Personally I have ordered almost everything from Garlic Breads to croissants to Thai curry to Deserts to the 4 course brunches, it‚Äôs all been really yum!   I must add here that marriot with their amazing service and food have kept our spirits high.Thank you Karishma and the entire team at Marriot hotels for an amazing service and food.   Pro tip :- The Tiramisu is just beyond amazing :)"
81,The J w Marriott juju was an amazing experience that me and my family enjoyed.   The staff and service was impeccable the food and beverages too were amazing  What really impressed me the most was the fact that every thing was socially distanced and well sanitized making us feel comfortable and safe in these covid times
82,Ordered 2 gourmet pizzas of different types and a delicious dessert. Both were delivered in record time piping hot and almost contact less. We enjoyed munching on the pizzas after a long stint with home made food. We will definitely try other dishes on their extensive home delivery menu.
83,"I stayed at the Marriott Juhu recently and it was the only change i got since the lockdown. All thanks to Mr. Karishma Vaid, she helped me from my reservation to making sure i got the kinda room I needed to brilliant hospitality. The most impressive thing was Karishma personally kept in touch via phone and made sure my stay was a refreshing one. Big thank you to her and the rest of the hotel staff everyone was aces."
84,"It was an amazing weekend. We were skeptical due to covid. We were celebrating my sister's birthday. A big thank you to Karishma Vaid for the bookings & making sure we had a pleasant, enjoyable & safe stay."
85,I could not contain my happiness when I got an email stating that J.W.Marriott Juhu has started home delivery for food.. So I ordered butter chicken..paneer ..dahi ke kebab..Ravioli Putanesca and Fruit cake.. And the food was hygenically packed n sooo tasty..the tea cakes have made my tea time something to look forward to..@jwmarriott
86,Rakesh - Manager handling MOW(Marriott on wheels) is amazing & goes beyond call of the duty. I got special Pineaaple Vegan cake which was amazing . So thanks to Chef for making great cake & Rakesh who is very supportive to deliver on time. Packaging is also good & all Covid related precautions are taken . Keep it up ! I am now regular customer since May 2020.
87,"We have been ordering quite frequently from JW Marriott Juhu.   We would love to mention and thank Ms. Karishma Vaid for the amazing top-notch service that she has been providing us.  Ordering food with so much ease has been possible only because of her. We have always received her kind cooperation in every order that we have placed. She has always been kind while helping us decide the menu.   Ms. Karishma looks into the needs and details of every order, the order is always delivered on time and is packed quite neatly. The food has been delicious everytime and they have an amazing menu. The ordering experience is quick and smooth.   Many thanks to Ms. Karishma and her lovely team at JW Marriott Juhu, for their exceptional services. The only Hotel that we would always consider"
88,"We decided to go for Marriott on Wheels option this Sunday since it‚Äôs been a long time that we had ordered any food. The ordering process was seamless. Ashish from JW Marriott gave his WhatsApp details so that we can order easily. We placed the order and they were extremely supportive when we requested for some changes considering our dietary preferences.  The food was at door step as promised. The person delivering food was neatly dressed, with mask and gloves and also was open for card payments. The food itself neatly packed.  And finally the food was yummy and all of us enjoyed it. Though we didn‚Äôt have it in the restaurant, it still was great in taste, not oily and great flavours. Overall it was a good Sunday lunch without stepping out of the home."
89,"The Covid-19 pandemic has changed so many things but there are some things which can still be enjoyed whilst being at home. The home delivery of food by Marriot has ensured that even as we stay locked indoors we can have some indulgence in a hygienic and safe manner. The person responsible for this is their guest relation officer Karishma who goes out of her way to service you. My first experience was on 31st May which was my 10th wedding anniversary. Upset at my travel plans being called off I was unsure of how the day could be special. In came Karishma like a knight in shining armour with her exotic menu and service. She assured us of the quality of food, delivery as well as sanitization service to keep us safe.  On the day the food arrived in perfect time by a chauffer from"
90,Rashmi Trivedi helped us choose the right room. Best customer service possible. She was very sweet and ensured we had a great time. Rashmi and the team informed of us all of the facilities. Thank you so much!
91,"It was very easy to order . They agreed to make something that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt on the menu too . The meal was  yummy , piping hot and arrived in 45 mins .  It was packed very well, completely sealed . The person delivering was wearing gloves and a mask .  Thank you !!!!"
92,had called for a family meal for 4 from Marriott on Wheels. It was delivered from Marriott Juhu. Amazing food. Excellent packaging. Quantity was also very good. Mouthwatering taste. The delivery was also well in time.  Would definitely order again
93,"Recently ordered food from Marriott hotel in Juhu by availing their Marriott on Wheels service. Ordering process is simple-ish. You can order by calling a phone number or by WhatsApp. Since this is a manual process, it takes a few extra minutes compared to Swiggy etc. However the staff is courteous as expected.   I ordered a Kerala egg biriyani and two stuffed kulchas. Both were delivered safely by the marriot staff (arrived in a Mercedes! Quite a pleasent contrast to Swiggy deliveries on a 2w. No complains though). It was raining heavily and not to forget there is a raging pandemic. But the marriot staff delivered the food nevertheless. They were wearing masks and gloves and greeted with a namaste.   The food was excellent and so was the service. The biriyani was exceptional."
94,"Its Sat , 4 th July: dinner time . The ambient mood is perfectly set  over Beluga in hand and XRCD format of Patricia Barber‚Äùs Companion. So, the expectations are very high on the dinner we had ordered from Saffron. We decided to order cuisine and meats from different regions of India :Awadhi : Luknowi Nali Nihari Gogsht , Bughara Chicken Lasan and Allepey Prawns ( deep south ) ...the flavours were extremely authentic, meats were perfectly cooked .. the experience left us very speechless.. and the stomachs .. craved for more.. ( although the portions were generous) !  Additionally:  We can thank Mouli and her team who braved the the very challenging weather and delivered dinner in perfectly sanitised condition. Must add that Marriott‚Äùs the only Hotel we know who uses their own"
95,We ordered for Chocolate Hazelnut Cake from Bombay Baking Company.. It was absolutely amazing!!!! Every piece tasted like heaven. I'm just looking forward to dine at Mezzo Mezzo and Lotus Cafe at the Jw Marriott Juhu.. 10/10
96,Well it was home delivery so it was delivered on time and the person was taking all precautions. Except the portion size of the food there was nothing that was an issue. The delivery was hygienic and the orders are placed through WhatsApp.
97,"Excellent service by JW Juhu. Ritesh Pawar was v professional in giving me a vegetarian menu I needed as the preset menu had little choices for vegetarians. The level of hygiene was extremely high at delivery. Almost perfect. The delivery was done by Rahul with a face shield, gloves and he carried sterillium which is the best alcohol sanitizer. The packaging was excellent. Food quality was awesome. The delivery was delayed a bit but overall that didn't matter much. Great Service standards by JW during these tough times."
98,"During the lockdown, Marriott started home delivery of their food services, and I must say it is a great service. The food ofcourse is good, the delivery is hygienic and the orders are placed through WhatsApp. Its convenient and also delicious! Highly recommend it!"
99,"My wife and me checked into the Marriot‚Äôs Juhu to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 50 th birthday.  Not only did we receive an extremely warm welcome but were upgraded to the premiere club room with a breathtaking view. There was a surprise cake cutting organised for my wife. The breakfast and meals were outstanding. In these difficult Covid times, the service was par excellence with a special mention for MD Rashmi Trivedi, who made us feel real special.  Thank you. Look forward to visiting again."
100,good stay ever had its one of the best stay we had loved its and will recommended others to and our family to we are just pleased to spend here again and a very positive vibe we had just awesome will go again
101,"We arrived Mumbai two days before the visa suspension for all foreign visitors went into effect with only a two-night reservation.  With all the border lockdowns going into effect, we needed to extend our stay to six nights at least before we could reserve seats on an outbound flight to connect to a USA flight.  The Marriott not only extended our stay, but upgraded us to a lovely room.  In particular, Devanq at the check-in desk was welcoming and helpful in ensuring a positive stay in spite of the stress of cancellations and border crossings.  The entire staff is amazing. The only hotel we will consider for future Mumbai travel is the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu."
102,"Every morning we had breakfast at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and it was awesome. We had the opportunity to try many Indian delicacies from different curries, dosas, and Indian ice cream. If you‚Äôre not a fan of Indian food, you probably should not go to India, but if you need a break from it, they had traditional English breakfasts, yogurts, and noodle soup. They have an extensive dink list to choose from but our favorite  was the masala chai, a great way to start your day and end your meal.   The service at breakfast was top notch. Nakul, Guvinder, and Bahrat took great care of us during each meal, but in reality everyone was just so helpful and attentive. They treated us so kindly, brought us anything we needed. On our last day, they genuinely encouraged us to come back and visit"
103,"Great hotel, customer service is excellent. Reception area very clean and tidy and the team were very courteous and helpful Concierge was extremely helpful.  I would recommend booking a car through the hotel, you can book one according to mileage for 4 or 8 hours and the drivers are very helpful directing you to the sights you want to see and ours was very helpful in advising us where to get tickets etc Pool area is well managed and the team around the pool are very attentive.  They supply you with water and ensure you have towels laid out on your sun loungers Executive Lounge is very well laid out to get the maximum seating in what is a very busy lounge.  The team in there make you feel welcome and they all work extremely hard.  They recognise you after a few days and will do"
104,"Beautiful property with amazing interriors. The staff are very friendly. Special thanks to Mr. Dhiraj Shetty at the bar for providing an amazing customer service experience. Very efficient, professional, pleasant and friendly.  Keep up the great work Dhiraj!"
105,"I stayed at JWM juhu Tara rd from 5 to 8 March 2020. When I booked by phone a twin room  the guy Justin booked me a King room. Even though I confirmed with him at least  5 times. Two hours later after receiving confirmation by email, I had so much hassle trying to convince Justin's manager to change my room to twin, which he kindly changed but when I reached hotel they offered me a King room. Luckily the reception staff were  helpful and offered me a twin room in the end. However, since then I have emailed more then 10 times asking them 3 simple questions regarding Marriott awards and  they keep on passing my query from customer care India, survey feedback people, then to customer care UK, reception area, express Medallia (whatever that is) . They are  useless, inefficient,"
106,Visited Lotus cafe for my Birthday Lunch.  Amzaing spread.  The chat section is just awesome.  Staff is quite attentive and soft spoken.  Dipendra from Food and Beverage assisted us quite well. Thank you so much Dipendra. Kudos! :)
107,"This hotel knows what hospitality is all about. People from other Marriott hotels should come here for training.  We always stay at the Grand Ocean Suite at this hotel. Excellent ocean front accommodation and very spacious. It is fit for long stays. We were there for 9 nights. Beautiful pool. It feels like an oasis to just chill on the lounge chairs.  As you enter the hotel you feel good with the ambiance of the lobby and the warm greetings from the staff.  It is a full service Marriott facility with an excellent spa. I spent one whole day at the spa getting treatments. The hotel is located close to shopping and  restaurants. I would like to commend Srikant, Chef Nakul and the other chefs at the Lotus cafe that made our stay excellent. Payal was selling Marriott vacations but"
108,"I wanted to take the time to highlight the concierge at the JW Marriott Juhu Mr. NOOR for going above and beyond to help retrieve a laptop that was taken by Airport Security. Not only did he call the GVK office to assist but also had a driver assist in helping retrieve the laptop from GVK! I cannot thank Mr. NOOR enough for his extremely helpful guidance and help with a very critical issue. He also was amazing at providing help for other local questions and was very courteous, respectful and prompt in getting back to me. Thank you so much! The JW Marriott JUHU is extremely lucky to have such a valuable team member as part of their Concierge team"
109,"The Lotus Restaurant had sumptuous food and a good spread.  They had healthy and nutritious options and a good variety.  Chefs Alok and Chef Amit were excellent as they prepared special meals based on my restricted dietary requirements.  We had a late dinner and they normally close after 11 pm, but the two members of Staff, Vinod Cardoza and Sagar Surve were so helpful and efficient and provided excellent service.  Also had the pleasure of meeting GM Mr Sharadji, who was so humble and down to earth.  Also Rohitji Tiwari, The Manager was excellent with his advice and help.  Really good hotel and worth the stay."
110,"Firstly Marriott, always my first priority,  Secondly located at the beachside, then the awesome view of their few rooms and then amazing staff and hospitality !!   What else one can ask for, stayed here for 3 nights, Apart from what one expects from Marriott is the courteous, polite and efficient staff of this property.   Each and everyone be it from Operator to the front desk, housekeeping to IRD, everyone ensured that we had a pleasant stay.   From check-in to check out, everything was smooth, elegant and worth visiting again, and would definitely want to give the credit to such amazing Duty Managers, to lead such a team. Heartfelt thanks to Tarun and Manisha (DM) who were always ready to go the extra mile, to make this experience memorable."
111,"I stayed here for 3 nights and had the best time. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and polite. The spa and all the amenities were spectacular. And so was the service. Nellini at reception was on her toes making sure our trip went on without any glitch. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. All in all, I'd give the whole experience 10/10!  Cheers."
112,I took my wife for her birthday to this beautiful hotel and have to say it lived up to all my expectations. The check in was smooth and they upgraded us from a deluxe ocean sea view to an executive sea view room. The staff at the desk were all very helpful and have to mention Monica for being a super host. The room was spacious and clean as you would expect and the view was amazing. It had all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. Rajesh our room attendant and he was always on hand if we required anything more. The breakfast in the morning is the highlight of our day. There was so much food and a varied choice. You could sit here for a couple of hours eating and looking at the wonderfully landscaped garden. The staff again so polite and attentive to our needs. By the second day they
113,"I had booked a royal lotus suite room which is the top notch of the jw marriott. The check in was so very simple and no extraordinary plus no one helped us to escort to our room for the room tour. We had a complimentary cocktails but no one served us nor in the reception area or at the room. When we entered the room the tables were full of dust. We even had free access to the executive lounge but there was good treatment in the lounge as well like asking for some drink or food or anything to us as they were asking all the others who were present in the lounge.  The overall stay was very very  basic and average for what the imagination was. The suite room is nothing extra ordinary and i never felt luxury compared many other good property as st regis, taj, oberoi etc. I would"
114,"Stayed in JW Marriott Juhu on the recommendation of a local company and it lived up to its reputation. Hotel offers a high standard and is clean, functional and delivers an excellent place to stay.  Greeted warmly at reception and a reasonably quickly checkin process. Room was of a high quality. Only stayed 1 night but also ate in the restaurant down stairs where the food was of a high quality. Friendly and knowledgeable staff all round.  Would highly recommend."
115,This is one of the signature hotels of Marriot. Truly reflective of the same. Classy interiors and super friendly staff. Very professional. Breakfast quality and spread is excellent. We went of a personal visit and my wife just felt pampered and happy.
116,I had asked about upgrading our rooms to access the Executive Lounge prior to arrival and was offered a rate for this. At check-in I asked about this and has very happily informed that we would be upgraded without any charge! The Executive Lounge was also very good with a live cooking station in the evening serving lovely street food. The facilities were very good. I would also state the breakfast was probably one of the best I have seen in India and globally with many live cooking stations with exceptional choice. It was also great that sparkling water at breakfast was offered at no charge (Perrier) - something that other hotels want to charge for. Overall an excellent property on the beach with expectational staff and service.
117,"The hotel grounds are nice, but the hotel is not very child friendly and I would not recommend it for families with young children.   We are currently staying in suite, as we checked in, the front desk confirmed the booking of one extra bed, this was at 2pm. At 10pm, we stopped by the front desk on our way in from dinner, again requesting the missing bed, at 10.30 pm we called room services asking for the bed (again). They confirmed they had never had a request for a bed, it would take a minimum 25 min for it to arrive. 11pm the bed arrived and we could put our children to bed.   The children wanted to play with a soft plastic ball in the pool and were told they were not allowed. There is only one main pool.  The first day we accepted is as it was 2-3 other people in the pool."
118,Today we dined at the Lotus Cafe.The staff was very warm.A special mention for Mr.Gurvinder who went an extra mile to make us comfortable.We had a wonderful experience while dining today.The buffet spread was also different than previous ones so it was quite refreshing.
119,"This Hotel is quite the gem of the area it is located in, its very iconic, specially because its been around for such a long time prominently, every time here is lovely, I visited this property after almost 4 years but its still the same old, as great as ever, the check in process was very smooth, Mr. Ruzbeh from the front office department was very kind and welcoming, assisted me and my partner with an early check in as we had a meeting to attend in the day, the room had a spectacular view, the PR lady of the hotel specially called up my room to check with me that if I was comfortable, these are the little touch points that actually matter and go a long way with a persons stay, the housekeeping department was very efficient and kind with doing our room. Loved the vibe of the"
120,"Have been trying to book a room through their I house reservation team but when we call no one answers the call was trying for 2 days in vain, finally I called the FnB manager since I have his no.asked him to help me with alternate no.he gave me duty managers no.which again went no reply she din even bother to return my calls. Finally managed to speak with some Chaitanya and Sana from the club Marriott team but assured me that they they will arrange a call back as soon as the duty manager gets free which again never happened. The same thing happened in the month of Jan when we were planning a 2 night stay there was no response no call back so we gave up n chkd into the Taj at the airport. I even msgd the GM Mr Puri but he also seems to ignore......like leader like team. Club"
121,"Back to my favorite hotel. Wish the bakery served a more interesting variety of foods but love the masala cheese omlette here. Jessica and Snowhill are always kind and helpful to meet all my extra quirky needs(extra butter, hot drinking water, side of greens please). Vijay at the concierge helped me immensely this time. My first time traveling alone and he made sure I had everything I needed to feel safe and knowledgeable with all my travels needs. I will recommend this hotel every single time."
122,I am a Marriott Bonvoy Gold Member and have travelled and stayed at JW Marriott and Marriott across the world. But JW Marriott Juhu is bad beyond expectations. From service to staff behaviour it‚Äôs anything but a Marriott. Being a Gold Member I get upgrades. Hotel staff gave me a room and told me they will upgrade in sometime as the room is not ready. Till 6-7 pm I kept on inquiring but no reply. I tried contacting Duty Manager but no reply. Then around 6-7 pm they sent a person with a room key of another room but no apology.  Then I had to wake up for an early morning flight so I requested for a cup of tea alongwith with the wake up call. But tea didn‚Äôt come and came only after 25 mins. Again no apology. The behaviour of the staff is not at all hospitable. The duty manager never
123,"The level of personalized service at this hotel is extraordinary. Especially in the club lounge, where they know you by sight after your first visit, and even remember your drink preferences. Another real standout is the breakfast buffet, which is the most varied and extensive I have seen anywhere in the world. It's more like a brunch on steroids than a breakfast. My personal favorites were the regional food stations and the mix-your-own juice bar that offered almost a dozen different fresh-squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. I've been there 3 times now, and every time is delightful."
124,"Since last year 2019 thi has been my favorite hotel for my stay while on duty at Mumbai, India. i love the most hospitable well versed dignified loving staff here. Being an Marriott Bonvoy Member I prefer this outstanding sea view hotel which help me on my early morning walk along Juhu beach, followed by varieties of delicacies at breakfast Indian north and south, western outstanding mouthwatering dishes and continental breakfast. The rooms offered with sea view are best feeling me like I am  asleep amidst nature... i thank all the concerned staff at reservation, breakfast room service everywhere who take good care of me and though i could name a few , others will be hurt as all are the best at Marriott true to there service logo of "" Experience Marriott Treatment at its best""."
125,"Truly a superb time especially for the kids! Loved the executive lounge, excellent service from the staff at the front desk. Special shout out to Vijay was went out of his way to ensure we have an excellent stay. Kudos to the whole team..."
126,JW Marriott Juhu!! Stayed at JW MARRIOTT 3/1/20  Sitting here today having breakfast with my wife at JW Juhu.   HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!   Waiters are standing around girls working here talking and not paying any attention to guest.   Same thing happened last nite at dinner here. Horrible service. We have to wave at waiters to get service. Akshay and few others were really good with their guest.   I‚Äôm amazed!!! With JW STANDARDS!! Two young managers are here basically standing around talking to associates!! WOW where is the guest service!!  Then my wife went to get the puri and ask the guys at the dosa station she(prajkta) told my wife is at the back. Then the guys at the dosa station told the girl you should go help her.   Food was awesome for breakfast but dinner buffet
127,"We had an amazing time at JW in Juhu, as usual the hotel lived up to expectations. Particular note is made to the concierge team of Vijay, Noor and Lewis, who always find a solution and never let us down, Thank you. A big thanks to executive Chef Alok and Nakul whose team made eating so enjoyable. See you all soon, a home to home"
128,"Had the best experience at the JW Juhu. We were celebrating our anniversary over a staycation and Tarun at the front desk made it a memorable one. We got upgraded to an Ocean facing room and they even included a complimentary breakfast. They ensure my five year old was looked after very well and even surprised us in the evening with flowers, a bottle of wine and the most amazing chocolate mousse cake. This was service above and beyond...you guys rock!! Special shout out to Tarun!!"
129,"We have been coming to this hotel since it opened, but the experience keeps getting better and more memorable every time! Everything from the staff and their service, the food, the ambience and the poolside is simply impeccable. From check-in to departure, all the staff have been going above and beyond to cater to our needs and make us feel like we were at home.   The exquisite food and hospitality during breakfast at the Lotus Cafe is second to none, and we are lost for words to describe our immense appreciation to all of the staff there.   Again all the staff in the Executive Lounge were incredible, always ready to serve us at the highest level with a smile, and bent over backwards to ensure all our needs were met!   As always, the pool staff, lifeguards, personal trainers,"
130,"Definitely one of the next beachfront properties in Juhu that has the best buffet facility for both lunch and dinner. The Quan spa is expertly managed and gives some of the best treatments available in Mumbai. As day guests we paid 2,000 rupees + tax  each to use the pool facility and it‚Äôs well worth it as this time of year the weather is perfect and due to off-peak plenty of Sunbeds available. The director of the pool deserves special credit for running an excellent service and his team of pool guys are courteous and attentive. You can access to the beautiful beach and if you are a Marriotts Bonvoy member, gain points and discounts for your food and beverages. Make it a point to visit the facility, even if non-resident, and join the Bonvoy programme you get accepted more easily."
131,"JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu üè© A beautiful property at a wonderful location. Providing an awesome view of the sea. üåä  This was our first stay in JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu and I can say that its been a exhilarating experience. The hotel dazzles with its luxury from the very first look and attaches with its excellent service at the very end. You can feel they want you to have an experience that enriches you and lasts in your memories!   A heartfelt thanks to Front Office Manage ‚ÄúGaurav Batra‚Äù who was extremely courteous, friendly and helpful.... His behaviour was superb and he helped us in best possible way. We would love to stay here again. Highly impressed. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
132,"The hotel provid ed a great end to our 2 month holiday in Indian. Exceptional hotel and super exec lounge facilities. Staff couldn't  be more helpful and engaging, nothing seem to be too much trouble. Lovely pool(s) area and poolside bar. Loved the breakfast dosa in lounge. Highly recommend."
133,Second time I have stayed here and what a pleasure it was. Monika in particular was extremely helpful and made our stay perfect. Nothing was too much for her and the hotel.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumbai.
134,"As usual, fantastic stay with great service..... what can I say ... 7 star treatment and amazing facilities .... the gym fitness trainers, receptionists all recognized me as soon as they saw me.... unbelievable after 3 years !!!  Special Thanks to Monica who went out of her way to look after us  The exec lounge was the perfect icing on the cake where Sachin Pedlekar spolit us with tasty & delicious food.   The Grand foyer is 2nd to none with perfect ambiance  All restaurants within international cuisines not to forget the perfect breakfast each morning !!!  Thanks and we shall return soon"
135,"This was my second visit to JW Marriot Juhu. I want to mention Room Office Manager Mr Rohit was extremely helpful, courteous and friendly. He treated us extremely well and it was superb dealing with him. Also Head of Concierge - Vijay was awesome and on top of his things. The staff service was top notch and that's a direct reflection of the leadership at this hotel lead by you (Sharad). It was my reunion with my parents, and you made sure that it was as memorable as last time which was 2 years ago. Leaving last for the best, your spa is Best in the whole world. Special credit and kudos to Gunjan. I have never experienced something this special and calming. My highest endorsement for her to make me fly just for a day to visit the Spa and feel treated very special. Hope to see you"
136,"Visited this place and we had ordered a pizza and 4 coffees, food is good but toppings were less in the veg pizza and it was a think crust pizza and coffee was also good. Ambience is good here and good place to click pictures, coffee is expensive but since it is a big place so it is justified."
137,"Hi friends  My only intent to write to you this long and unpleasant email is to support you get better. My husband is a platinum Bonvoy member and has stayed for, I guess, 500 nights at SPG properties. I stayed with him and finally thought of becoming an independent member as i travel for work often.  However, i want to report  about the incident today.    It got ridiculous on day 1 itself. Today is 23rd of Feb 2020. At check-in,  I swiped my international charge card for 2 nights and was allotted room 377 (and we discussed at length how this card does not block money but charges it instantly). Seeing how this could be a problem, proactively, I offered to pay for each day's food bill at the reception so that we follow a process (I seriously hope you have call recordings because"
138,Right next to juhu beach - easily walking distance to beach from the hotel - and then the sea view rooms are great options.  Room size is small but thats the norm in Mumbai.  Food options are good. The indian reataurant - next to coffee shop is a great option for a leisure dining experience.  Rizo rizo served my apetite for Italian well.  Dashanzi is good too.  Its a celebrity hotel. There is always some one in the lobby.  Staff is polite and efficient.
139,Very good  ambience..food was very good and staff was excellent even chef came to meet us had a great time.My sisters 60th birthday was really memorable. This is the 3th.time we r coming to dasange same group of 20 people.love it
140,We are permanent guest of JW Marriot.....We always love to stay in your property......This was our first visit to JW Marriot Juhu I want to mention that Front office Manager Mr Gaurav Batra was extremely helpful courteous and friendly.... He treated us extremely well and it was superb dealing with him.....We would love to cone here again. Highly impressed. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
141,"Stayed here on Feb 19 and I would say the customer service is at its best that I have experienced in Marriott properties. Special mention to MR.Akshay Dikshat at the reception, who took a very good care on Checkin. I didn‚Äôt know the Lounge access has been discontinued for Bonvoy Gold members, but on request he immediately gave me the access. Hats off, you have been exemplary. Being a Bonvoy Gold member, I was upgraded to a Suite room with Juhu beach view, the views from the room was stunning.  The breakfast spread was exceptional, and the hotel is centrally located with lot of eateries around, just in a walking distance you have Mahesh lunch home, which is one my favourite Sea Food restaurants in India. Overall I would highly recommend this property."
142,"Everything about the stay was exemplary and true Marriott class experience which keeps raising the bar every time.  Smooth check in (thanks to the front desk staff who thoughtfully offered a tea to my mom who looked visibly tired after a long flight).  The room and the amenities exceeded expectations and made for a memorable stay.  Not only was the breakfast fabulous (both in spread and taste), thanks also for the gesture in adding it as a complimentary benefit at such a short notice.  Loved the decor, the coffee shop and special mention to the pool side beach access.  Also worth calling out was the friendly demeanor of the door staff who helped with hailing cabs.  Thanks a lot JW Juhu for going above and beyond and providing a truly Elite experience."
143,"JW Juhu is one of my favourite hotels across the globe. The property is spectacular, service is top notch, tons of bars & restaurant options available all night. The pool area is exceptional and the sunset views from the executive lounge are mesmerizing!!"
144,Wonderful hotel. Rooms brilliant. Excellent vibe and pool is lovely. Breakfast is outstanding - you won‚Äôt need to have lunch! Juhu is a great location. Staff very helpful and attentive. The best hotel to stay at in Mumbai!
145,"My wife and I would never stay anywhere else!  From the time we walk in to the time we leave, we always feel welcomed.  The staff service is top notch and that's a direct reflection of the leadership at this hotel.  Sunil thank you for always taking care of us.  We look forward to seeing you again!"
146,the executive lounge is so full it is like an indian railway station. no seats . no food left and the drinks don't arrive after 3 requests  when you ask for some help from the reception desk the manager is too busy doing his personal emails
147,Superb experience. Good ambience great food superb service and overall fun. Happen to go there twice in 15 days both times the experience was very good. The dessert spread was very good with a varied variety.
148,Extremely terrible experience with the club membership.They are taking members for a ride.  Food in the Lotus Cafe was terrible(not a single dish in the buffet was good).  Service is terrible. No one ever picks up the membership number.  They will not accommodate any requests whatsoever. Also they change the rules randomly as per their convenience. Very disappointed with the service. Feels like a waste of money.
149,I along with my office colleagues had celebrated our Annual meet at Kaveri conference hall which was close to the hotel lobby having a grandeur appearance. The meet turned out to be a bliss and gala with all the arrangements done by the courteous staff of the hotel. I will surely visit it again to enchant myself.
150,Had such a busy month with wedding shopping for my daughter in India Navsari  Now ready to relax for couple of days in JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu- still the same so lovely to come back here after 2years and l love their hospitality and their friendliness with all their guest  So glad they haven‚Äôt changed much!
151,"I chose my first four and last three days of holiday to stay at this beautiful hotel, to treat myself.  I booked the premier,larger club room, but the room i was allotted had smallest of the possible area to put suitcases in. I went to complain ( a big mistake ) as from then on, it was a cold indifference. As a Marriott Bonvoy gold member, I have always been offered an enhanced upgrade, but not this time.and they could do nothing about my disappointment. It was plain and simple get on with it. On my last evening, I brought a prominent Hollywood personality to the club lounge and I had pre-informed the importance of this evening to the manager on duty and yet like a naughty schoolboy, I was asked my room number and then in front of my guests, riot act of extra charges was read"
152,"Celebrate your special day, with special people, by special people. Excellent service, delectable food, beautiful view, pleasant music and a warm-welcoming staff; that makes sure you feel special !  üòä"
153,"Very nice spread, nice ambiance and nice service.we all had a good time enjoying our food and drink. Excellent staff, very polite and always eager to help.  The choice of spread was excellent.  Thanks for everything."
154,"We had a great time as a family  at the JW Juhu Marriott!! The welcome experience was fantastic with good service throughout, great food and lovely views from the hotel. Staff were very friendly and professional with great attitude.  My son enjoyed the stay as much as we did and would love to visit again."
155,I visited with my family and we loved the place. The staff was very courteous and professional. I would highly recommend this place to others looking for a place with 5 star facilities and great service.
156,"I stayed in this hotel while I was in Mumbai for work. The hotel is located centrally. Since i had to meet people in Powai and Lower Parel the location of the hotel suited me well. The facilities in hotel are good. The staff is responsive and take good care of alone female traveler. Being new to mumbai, they really helped me with transport options and route to travel. Food in their lotus cafe and other stand alone restaurants is amazing. When i visited, they had Hyderabad festival going on and the food was really amazing. I really enjoyed my stay and felt secure in the hotel. Looking forward to stay with them going forward."
157,I had a great stay at JW Marriott Juhu with lot of amenities and good hospitality üòç Food was awesome here and with best sea view‚ù§Ô∏è Lounge and music at lotus cafe was heavenüòá Staff attitude is more appreciative.  Planning to visit again and again. Cheers..üòä
158,"Visited the property last month for work, had an amazing experience throughout the stay. Loved the food and service at Lotus cafe, staff attitude was very good and welcoming. Beautiful pool, dined at Mezzo Mezzo Italian restaurant , food was delicious. Overall a very highly recommended property."
159,"I stayed in Marriott along with my family and my stay has been very great. I will definitely recommend family stays in this hotel.  I was travelling with a kid and hotel ensured I have all amenities Like colours and chocolates in room to keep my kid busy. The rooms are big and housekeeping staff is very friendly. All rooms are properly lit and toiletries in bathroom are very good.  Their in house restaurants options are wide. You can jump from Indian to Italian and south east Asian. Me yes are very well thought off. While ordering food they were very considerate about my kids food preferences and were ready to do things out of box.  In the lobby, staff is really helpful and have prompt response in case of any need. The check in was quick and without any hassle.  View from hotel"
160,I had stayed in the Marriott hotel in the month of January. The overall experience was outstanding. I would rate the hospitality from the staff was simply outstanding. Great choice of food and I particularly loved the breakfast. The rooms also offer excellent views and a stunning lounge.
161,"Great hospitality by a warm and welcoming staff nice food quite an approachable location  and very easy to get around the city great view loved the room, music at lotus cafe was really nice surely coming back soon"
162,"I booked this hotel for a long weekend whilst I was working in Mumbai. I booked three nights with my husband as he was coming to visit me in Mumbai. I was looking forward to the same standards that I had been receiving at JW Marriott Sahar by the airport (which is fantastic). I also saw some beautiful pictures of a stunning infinity pool overlooking the sea which I was excited by.  On checking in, our room wasn't ready. We arrived at 12:30ish and had to wait an hour. We couldn't use the outdoor facilities during this time as you need a key card to get through the door. The reception tried to sell us access to the executive lounge for 5000 rupees per day which somehow quickly dropped to 4000. We declined even though I had heard good things about it. I asked how much a room"
163,Fantastic hotel that is made by the amazing staff in the lotus cafe ... big recommendation to Mohsin and Ritesh who made sure our breakfast and dinner arrangements were always special ... these guys go way above what any traveller would expect... the executive lounge staff (Nana in particular) was extremely helpful and attentive. thank you to the amazing staff at this hotel that made our stay ....
164,Hotel staff really ignorant and careless. Day before my arrival hotel staff calls and asks for my preference. Requested for upgrade and sea facing view. That was just only formality. On day of arrival they did not offer upgrade or sea facing room. Hotel did not even upgrade room.   During night dinner order placed were not delivered on table. Overall experience was disapointing.   They committed to do it on next day. Amen Anar contacted me on my WhatsApp number and asked if she could be of any help. Attaching conversation of amazing response.   Really disappointed with Marriott reservation desk staff and Amen Elite Ambassador. Not sure why she wasted my and her time if she has nothing to response.   My humble request do not waste time if you don't like to respond.
165,"The property is in a prime location in Mumbai and is a massive building overlooking the Arabian sea . The rooms are wonderful and modern and have all the amenities . I really liked the breakfast area and the spread . The staff is wonderful and helpful . Overall , a wonderful place to spend your time ."
166,We booked a 3 night break in a ocean view executive room. On arrival there was no personal greeting as we are accustomed to at a 5 *hotel. We walked up to the check in desk no smiles checked in and given our passes to go the room ourselves again totally shocked as we are always shown to the room by a member of staff. Room 532 was a room from Hell. On turning off the AC the whirring noise from the rooftop was unbearable. We phoned reception 5 times and 2 hours later duty manager arrived by this time it was midnight. We were moved down to a 4th floor room for the night but after all the hassle did not sleep well. Customer services manager sangeeta was the first person I spoke to never saw her totally useless.  Next morning we were not contacted so had to go and find duty manager
167,"This hotel is of a very high standard & what I expected. Excellent security & efficient reception staff. The room was stylish with a well-designed bathroom with modern sliding partitions & powerful shower. Very comfy bed & sleek desk unit. Overall, staff are helpful, friendly & efficient. Breakfast was a wide array of international and local Indian foods, egg station etc with freshly cooked options such as crispy masala dosa and parathas etc. But I have two small observations that stopped me from giving it full marks. 1. The main restaurant area is really huge - like an aircraft hanger - and has very little atmosphere indeed (despite the evenings' live piano music from a gifted musician). The tables are set in rows and rows and it feels like mass catering & rather soul-less."
168,"I was in Mumbai to get married in a Hindu wedding ceremony as my hubs and I are based in the States.  My husband and I opted to stay in a hotel to make things easier for his family.   I had multiple dresses which were needed for the wedding, but absolutely crumpled from traveling.  Even though it was an extremely busy time of the year (over new years), the hotel staff managed to steam my dresses, and assorted family members dresses, on very short notice and deliver each one on time.    Overall, the customer service at the hotel was fabulous.  The hotel itself was beautiful, and the breakfast was lovely every morning.  Also the new years eve party was very fun!"
169,Vijay at concierge was second to none. He even responded to requests out of hours and the overall service by the hotel was amazing. They went out of their way to ensure we were attended to. The food was amazing.
170,Amazing hotel with a festive vibe. Rooms are excellent value. The restaurants and the entertainment completed a wonderful stay. The location in Juhu on the beachfront and near many shopping spots is an incredible addition to a luxury stay. Highly recommended
171,"I enjoyed staying at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu, which is an luxury hotel ‚Äûold style‚Äú. Large lobby, excellent service, great lounge, however sometimes a bit run down. The best part ist the awesome pool! Direct beach access is nice, but don‚Äôt expect the beach to be like US and Europe - simply too crowded..;)"
172,"I would like to compliment the excellent Check in staff. Sahir was outstanding & patient. My group upon check in can be overwhelming, but Sahir was friendly, patient, kind, helpful & very efficient. His colleagues Saif & Pascoal were just as friendly & helpful. Actually, I appreciate the  hardwork & professionalism of the entire staff. Sahir & staff are all ""ROCKSTARS! Thank you, Yolanda Jones"
173,The staffs at JW made our stay extremely memorable üå∑!! From the flowers and balloons to the awesome gesture by Kumar  of bringing breakfast for us to our room as my little boy was feeling under the weather made me feel soo warm.. special mention to the chef that offered to make 3 min noodle for my 3 yr as he was refusing to eat anything from a billion scrumptious options served for breakfast .. he actually ate those noodles without a fuss üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëº what else can a mother want!! Such special attention and care really touched my heart.. keep up the good work‚ù§Ô∏è
174,"Excellent service from Checking to checkout  Responsible,Attentive staff who make sure that your staff is comfortable and homely  Breakfast catered for almost all needs fasting food to festive food , Children and Elderly with special needs catered for with utmost care  Chefs and waiting-staff ensured that majority were happy  Pool was excellent, Gym is being reorganised again had major equipment , Spa and saloon services to standard"
175,"The staff at this hotel provide top notch service.  The rooms are clean.  Our housekeeping team (Ganesh) left flowers, snacks and a clean room. The food is great.  The spa has everything you need to relax.  I highly recommend this facility."
176,the food spread was amazing i was not happy with the DJ it was quite boring. i would not do my new years there again. the washrooms was pathetic no water was available. if you are going just for dinner its great
177,"I would have had rated them 2.3, if I had an option.  A huge property in a posh area but lacks hospitality and commitment from the staff and management.  Starting with great gesture from snehal who checked us in. As a Titanium member, I can check in anytime from 8 AM but reached Mumbai after our trip to shirdi around 5.30. Snehal helped us get an early check in without any charge.  Praful at the breakfast buffet was on his toes and man, what energy this guy has, handling all the guests and their asks on New year's morning. Kudos.  First of all, guests come to hotel to enjoy, relax, so who puts conditions like wearing not wearing shorts and sandals inside the lounge during cocktail hours. I hope you know that I came from my Canada Trip before Christmas and trust me, it's really"
178,Stayed at Juhu Beach after 20 years. What a change... The beach is so clean and beautiful. The Marriott is such a beautiful hotel and is situated in such a lovely location. Fortunate to have had a room with sea view room 476. From the time we entered we were treated so well. The staff are exceptionally courteous. The Executive Chef at breakfast was so helpful and was very willing to spice up some bake beans. On the second day he remembered my name and asked if there was anything he could do. Saif at the front desk gladly extended our stay for one more day at a nominal rate. Sachin who attended to our room was most helpful. In fact every staff member always greeted us and we really felt  the staff are like family. Usually head for hotels on Marine drive. Changed my mind big time.
179,"We had a series of rooms booked over the new year period, a few hiccups initially as some of the rooms were different to the booking but reception staff were very accommodating and had things sorted out by the end of the day and gave us interim rooms in the meantime. Special thanks to Rashmi for her excellent service and organisation.  The hotel is otherwise as you would expect from JW: - spacious and contemporary design - great pool and surrounding water features - fantastic hotel rooms, well appointed with all amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel - excellent gym open 24hrs with trainers available, separate male and female sauna and steam areas with Jacuzzi and chilled pools - buffet spread is unbelievable with everything from quinoa to freshly made paneer parathas,"
180,We have had another wonderful stay at the JW....made extra special by the fantastic breakfast and especially great service by Chef Alok who made us feel like family together with Abhishek Basu. Similarly following a minor issue which was rectified promptly the stay was superb and a special thanks the Rohit Tiwari and Akshay Dixit for looking after us. Look forward to returning back soon.
181,"Abhishek Singh, front desk assistant manager. A massive asset to the team and we truly hope that he is recognised by the hotel manager. We have been to this hotel for the last 25 years and it‚Äôs people like him that go that extra mile and provide a five star service. He has made our stay extremely enjoyable and no doubt he will develop much further in his career. Outstanding service we age extremely grateful, most appreciated, Bharat Savani."
182,"I have been staying here for over a decade. Cant complain about anything. Brilliant service, lounge team is great, menu for breakfast is huge covering asian, Indian, western, and other cuisines. Sunday brunch is beyond any imagination with hundreds of options in the buffet. Views are divine from the room (make sure you get a sea facing room) and if you have lounge access then nothing like it with picture perfect views. Gym and pool are top end"
183,Excellent experience during one of the most busiest times in December- staff in the whole hotel were pleasant courteous and helpful.  Breakfast was extensive and varied for all.  The availability of unlimited choice with hot freshly cooked Indian and European cuisine makes this a splendid place to indulge!  Thanks to all the staff  Kusum & Bharat Shah
184,"The last leg in our tour of India was the greatly anticipated Juhu beach JW, and since this was the most expensive and impressive looking hotel it was a stay that was hotly anticipated.  Sadly so many issues meant the last of nights of our tour were not as we would have expected.  The good points - Really impressive hotel, with a beautiful location just on the beach - Stunning pool and room view overlooking the ocean - Excellent location - Really nice club room and a great place for breakfast.  The negative points - Service on entry is very poor, for example we had to look for a bell boy for our luggage to get collected and taken to rooms - Reception staff did not get any details about the room requirements which resulted in a hastily assembled trundle bed being sent to the room"
185,Had a wonderful time at the hotel. Breakfast was very good but over crowded (maybe seasonal). Special thank you to Vijay in Concierge who went out of his way to assist us with any concierge requirement. Special thanks to the chefs for cooking delicious meals for my son with special dietary needs.
186,"I stayed at this hotel in my recent trip to sidhi vinayak.  After check in which went very smoothly I was told to go to my room (little surprised that no one escorted me there but that's because we are Indians and have become used to that I think üòä) Secondly, the room I was given was at the extreme end and connected to another room where a family  Was staying and hence to get sleep in the afternoon Was impossible and as I had been awake the whole night before it was a disappointment and the lady who called to check on the guests also didn't do anything about it. Had decided will never come back to this hotel when i was forced to change my mind. I went down to the reception to ask them about a good place to eat as well as the dilemma I was facing with the noise. Will highly"
187,we loved it because: 1. security-checks were top notch 2. executive ocean suite is big and wonderful 3. the clublounge is perfekt 4. food there is delicious 5. breakfast is excellent 6. the poolarea had resort standard 7. beach is very clean
188,Stayed 3 nights whilst on vacation. Definitely worth the money and a 5 star hotel! The room was nice with beautiful partial ocean view and comfortable bed. Swimming pool area was huge to walk around and beautiful.Breakfast at Lotus Cafe where the buffet spread was lavish.I loved and enjoyed an outstanding service and hospitality given by every staff member.
189,"We have stayed many times at JW Marriott, but what brings us back is not just the beautiful property but the entire staff. It‚Äôs a home away from home. Our  special thanks firstly to Mr. Gaurav Bhatra for making our stay special as always with his personal touch right from checking in till departure. Super courteous and always ready to help in making our stay very comfortable. I must mention the staff at the executive lounge, Anil, Ajay, Rahul and Hemant always having welcoming smiles on their faces and the level of service was outstanding .  Thank you ."
190,Stayed with family group of 10 and really had a great few days here. The staff were super friendly and helping with whatever we needed.   The breaksfast buffet was one of the best I have had and must have put on a few kilos and couldn‚Äôt resist trying all the different dishes. They were all so good.
191,"Delightful hotel, the Lotus Cafe - cannot think of anything that was not on the menu!!! Personalised service and very tasteful. Amazing service everywhere in the hotel, not a single location at the hotel where the service was not 100%!! Very comfortable and spacious rooms very beautifully furnished. Child friendly hotel. I was there for a business meeting and everything was perfect"
192,We stayed here after our wedding. The rooms were decent. The breakfast spread was also good ! The pool is competitively small but the hotel has access to beach. Overall a decent stay experience at the property.
193,"Everything you would expect from a JW Marriott, top quality hotel and top level service. Breakfast buffet was exceptional. Swimming pool isn't huge but was fairly quiet when we were there so no issues. Layout of hotel is a bit strange, for example you have to walk through the dining hall to get out to the swimming pool, but these are really minor points. The only real negative is the that the rooms aren't very soundproofed, especially from the corridor and I would expect better from JW Marriott in this respect. We were very unlucky to be sandwiched in amongst a large family with young kids split between several rooms who made noise until gone midnight and again from early in the morning.¬† The doorbell from next door also sounded like it was in our room, which compounded the"
194,"Stayed a few nights whilst on vacation. Definitely worth the money and a 5 star hotel!  Service, both online and  during our stay was impressive and made you feel at home. The rooms are immaculate, well maintained and beds comfortable. Hotel in general well maintained.  Breakfast is well worth it ( an experience in its own right) - unlimited choice/selection, service and once just needs the appetite. Surprised they served fresh coconuts for breakfast.  Location location location - on Juhu beach but within walking to distance to a number of places and others via rickshaw, taxi or uber. Uber to international airport around 300 rupees. Taxi around 700 rupee.  If you have lounge access, another plus and you will be taken care.  There is a onsite ATM machine which allows you to use"
195,"I've stayed at the JW Juhu many times on business, and my last experience has to be one of the most memorable yet. The staff is always so friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and kind. My review however is to really spotlight Yasim Arfa, an incredible young women who is the hotel's Guest Relations Associate. She truly went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable, by staying connected with me through email and phone, checking up to see if I needed anything. This attention to detail and care really touched me, and it speaks to how authentic and caring she is. She was able to upgrade me to one of the most beautiful suites I've ever seen, and her and colleague surprised with a lovely cake and message in my room - and coming back this day late after a long day of meetings  and"
196,"The biggest advantage of staying at Juhu Marriott is that you are on the beach. The view from the room is just breathtaking, at all times of the day. And the fact that you just have to walk out of a door to be on the beach is like a cherry on the cake. The live music ( heard the maestro playing the jal tarang during breakfast), just added to the already lavish and delectable breakfast buffet.The staff is polite and pleasant. The rooms are nice and comfortable."
197,5/5 experience. Pathetically expensive but definitely worth every penny. The staff is very well trained and they take good care of you. Food is excellent and the rooms and spacious and very well done. Good Job Marriott !!!
198,"Had a lovely stay at the hotel with my husband . A week later checked in my mum and her sister for a short break . Sangita at the concierge was extremely helpful , pleasant and friendly . Other staff members like Tarun, Anil and Sameer were very helpful and courteous. Hope to see this team again next year ."
199,"‚ÄúThe Savant of spices‚Äù the ongoing Hyderabadi food festival at Saffron Juhu Marriott.......An extensive menu with traditional dishes, full of flavour from the erstwhile Nizam‚Äôs territory using the finest of ingredients and produce to satiate your taste buds.... created by Parveen Khan from Hyderabad..... much appreciated Sania khan"
200,My colleagues and I had an amazing experience at the JW Juhu. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left everything was exceptional. The staff was amazing they worked extremely hard to ensure everything during our visit was great. The lounge the restaurants and the bar did a great job. The rooms are very updated and comfortable   I will definitely be staying here every time I‚Äôm in Mumbai.
201,"My compliments to the staff who made my two day stay exceptional.  In particular, Monika and Sangita were the most helpful in helping me set up business meetings, identify exceptional dining options and evening events.  I would surely seek their advice again the next time I return to this hotel.  Mike"
202,Lovely spa with a great team. The spa treatment rooms are really lovely and the treatment was Dream-like. Very nice experience overall. I particularly liked the thoughtful amenities that are included and neatly tucked away in pretty drawers for one‚Äôs discovery in the room. They even provide a proper hairdryer in the treatment room itself.   I also tried the buffet dinner which offered a variety of delicious local and international dishes.
203,"My partner is a former long stay resident at the JW Marriott, Juhu. We met for the first time when working in India and staying at this iconic hotel. We are currently here on a return visit exactly one year after leaving India. When deciding to return for a holiday staying at the JW in Juhu was an obvious choice, it offers great facilities in a prime location, and has an exceptional team - many of whom we consider to be our personal friends.  Last night we enjoyed dinner at the Lotus Cafe and then decided to have drinks in Dashanzi. We arrived at roughly 10pm and took a seat on a sofa near the bar. At around 10:30pm, an area on the opposite side of the room was cordoned off and reserved for a VIP guest. Hotel staff stood there to ensure the seating in this area remained"
204,"Excellent service from - before the arrival to final checkout. Although all the Staff was very courteous and service focused, need to mention customer service rep Yasmin. She was proactive and ensured that I had an easy check-in even before leaving for India. Keep up the good work."
205,"Glad we stayed at this hotel. It was at a great location and easy to get around for shopping, food, etc. walking distance to Amitab Bachans house.   You have direct access to the beach.   The breakfast is a must at this hotel. The food was soooo good!!  The lighting in the rooms are a bit dull so hard to see when trying to get ready.   If i come back to Mumbai i would stay at this hotel."
206,"I have stayed here for long stay and am leaving the review due to the outstanding service I have received from the staff in the hotel.  Hotel amenities - excellent with all required facilities and beach access.  Dining - I was mostly dining and Lotus cafe. The food is 5 star quality and great variety. However what made the stay very was the excellent service I received from all staff.   Alok who is one of the main chefs and first person I met ensured that I always has great food and provided me with dishes outside the buffet which would be helpful as after a long time, you end up getting bored of the same dishes. Chefs Nakul, Stanley, Amit amongst others again ensured all the food I received was top quality and catered to my food requests example getting me some awesome veg dim"
207,"Here for 3 days mineral conference. A huge hotel which is well run with excellent facilities. Set close to the sea with a wide beach area and huge pools. It is relatively low with only 6 levels, it is well arranged with fast lift etc. The restaurants are excellent with a bonus view towards the pools and sea. Friendly staff and large very clean rooms. Would recommend this place for business or leisure."
208,"We had one more great weekend at this beautiful property. It was nice of them to give an early check-in. Thanks Sahil. I had requested for a room on 4th or 5th floor but got it on 3rd. I was told that later on they would change it but nobody contacted me. A little more attention would have better. However the room was very good with beautiful pool and sea view. We had lunch and breakfast at Lotus Cafe where the buffet spread was lavish. We went for coffee at executive lounge at 5 PM and were surprised to see cocktails being served so early. We again came at 8 and got excellent service.  The hotel had a lot of facilities but due to short stay, we used only swimming pool which was open till late in the evening.  Worth staying !!"
209,"This is so far one of the best hotel I have ever been in my life!  Curated in each single details, it is just wonderful and very organised staff.   The breakfast is incredible and the atmosphere too.  This is my favourite part of Mumbai.  For sure, I will be back."
210,"Pros-   The staff were very pleasant and bend over backwards to please you. That saved the day, otherwise the property is very dated.  Shrinavas kindly upgraded us to an executive sea view room as it was my birthday and guest services also arranged for a cake which was very sweet of them.  The hotel is keen to look after guests and were very quick to rectify a bad experience in the caf√©. Abishek  Basu the Executive Chef got in touch with us and arranged for a special birthday meal in the restaurant as a gesture of goodwill.  (To be honest, we would have overlooked the matter, had it not been for the feedback forms given to us at breakfast to fill in - this demonstrates that customer service is of paramount importance to the hotel).  We spent most of our time away from the hotel"
211,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful facilities and wonderful staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if visiting Mumbai. Room service was impeccable along with towel ‚Äú animals‚Äù Recommend you pay a little extra to use club facilities on 4th floor."
212,"I had a great stay at the Jw Marriott Juhu and the service here was impeccable.  I was constantly amazed at how attentive, kind and genuinely thoughtful all the staff members were. The room was nice with beautiful partial ocean view and comfortable bed.  Swimming pool area was huge to walk around and beautiful!! A special shout out to those I came across during my stay a sweet lady at the executive lounge named Ana(not sure if I get it right)who made sure I was well taken care of every evening I lounged there.  Visiting The Quan Spa was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made, I was welcomed by a very kind and attentive lady Named Teepy at the reception and gave me good recommendations, a fantastic massage done by Rupesh it was just what I needed to unwind. My experience at the spa"
213,It was my first visit to Mumbai and staying at the JW Marriot Juhu. My stay was for eight days. The service I received was excellent for my entire stay! Every staff member acknowledged me and was very polite and helpful. This really made me feel at home during my stay. Excellent customer service from all your staff .In the dining room for breakfast I was greeted by Akshay  and is friendly smile. He would ask me about my previous day and what I would be doing  today and showed genuine  interest and gave suggestions . Ritesh and his staff always made the food top-notch. Kudos  to all the chefs! Sangita front desk was fantastic and giving recommendations on where to go and where not to go.Mumbai can be an interesting place.  Kuschel at front gate never missed a ‚ÄúNamasta‚Äù. Very prim
214,"We had a week long fantastic stay at JW in the last week of October, going into early November. Landing late night from London, Hashmeet made the checkin process super fast at 2.00am, and gave us a great room overlooking the ocean. We were pampered throughout our stay by Pritpal & his team at the restaurants. We had stomach problems because we ate one of our meals outside the hotel, and they went out of their way to give us alternative (off the menu) light food options at any time we called room service. Poolside area and beach were fantastic. The Executive Lounge team (Sahil & Anil) made sure our wine glasses were perpetually full, and while it was quite crowded they made sure we were seated within minutes of entering. Really nice break for us. The hotel staff did a great job"
215,"Fabulous location of the hotel on Juhu Beach. The staff was absolutely amazing , especially one member, Sangita. She made our stay so wonderful because she was so proactive. Breakfast choices were unbelievable . Recommend it ."
216,"Thorough enjoyed my stay here. The service quality is impeccable. I visited Lotus Cafe many times and 3 cheers to the staff there. Gurvinder, Nikhil and Mohsin went out of their way for me. Truly amazing service and choice of food. Just one recommendation from me was that in the Breakfast buffet they should have a choice of local seasonal fruits. Apart from that I truly enjoyed my stay. Thank you Gurvinder, Nikhil and Mohsin."
217,"Celebrated my son's birthday. Hospitality was excellent. Rohit and Karishma from the Marriott team made my son feel very special. Brunch at lotus cafe,dinner at Mezzo Mezzo. Extremely courteous staff."
218,"The Hotel had all the facilities you would expect from a 5 star property excluding a working in-room safe, basic management professionalism and in-house security. Upon returning to my room in the evening at 9pm, I discovered my room had been entered and used.  The bathroom facilities had been used, not flushed, doors left wide open, all lights on and a ""black house keeping key card"" in the electric operator by the door.  Talk about leaving the evidence behind. Despite my constant request to attain a report regarding the unauthorised entry and usage, the Director of Rooms upon checkout (3 days after requesting) presented a word document listing the the security footage times (insisting that the room was only entered for 4 seconds).  It was not signed by him, was not on title"
219,"In the first 2 minutes upon entering, I was struck by how cold, unwelcoming and impersonal the staff was. Having just come from two other Bonvoy properties in India, where warm hospitality was in full abundance, this was quite shocking.  Then you notice that the place is rather worn down and in need of a good refresh when it comes to hallway carpets etc.     My room was small, but clean and comfortable.  The gym was nice, as was the pool area generally. The hotel‚Äôs website says something about being on the sandy beach along the Arabian Sea.  Technically it is, but there is a large metal gate and electric wire between it and the hotel.  You are permitted out during day time hours, and I understand the security concerns.  But if you were picturing a Mexico-type beach place, this"
220,This hotel was very nice. Clean and great service.  The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of foods. The pool area was well kept and clean. The landscaping outside was nice and offered seating and lawn for relaxation.
221,It has been a great evening and experience for us at this Cafe. Noel in particular looked after us very well and felt us feel special. Thanks to him. Spread was fantastic. Hats off to the Chef. Look forward
222,"This hotel is beautiful, clean and has all the conveniences. The staff is wonderful. The rooms are big and beds very comfortable. The breakfast buffet has everything. Definitely bring an appetite. If they don‚Äôt have something, just ask and they may make it. The spa is so nice and relaxing. I got a 90 min message with hot stones. Sachin Rao was wonderful. I don‚Äôt usually get a message from men, he made me feel very comfortable and he was professional. The fitness area is one of the largest I have been too and has everything for your workout. I really enjoyed my stay."
223,Good location provides the best quality food restaurants   Staff are very courteous nothing is too much for them .  They are hospitable reception staff also very efficient. club lounges provide mixed variety of snacks and fresh fruit .
224,"We stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu for 6 nights starting on the 18th of October. This was a trip to celebrate our anniversary and our second stay at this property this year.  The hotel location can not be beat and the hotel is beautiful. However this hotel does not recognize or appreciate guests who are Bonvoy members. We are titanium members and the agent who checked us in mentioned twice in a dismissive manner, that our stay was using points. I found this very demeaning. Our room was very small and  had a bathroom that was tiny. The agent also mentioned that they get many celebrities and are quite busy though out the year. The service at this hotel does not meet the standards for a five star hotel, in fact it was bordering on rude. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job and"
225,"I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough!  Rooms are modern and clean.  Breakfast and Dinner buffet is delicious, high quality food, great selection and a bonus having live instrumental players at breakfast.  The food in the Thai restaurant, Dashanzi, was delicious where we were given free cocktails and desert. Above all, the service was brilliant, all the Concierges, house keeping, and restaurant staff were so kind and helpful.  A big thanks to Looks Salon for fitting us in last minute for having our hair done.  Will definitely be staying here every time I‚Äôm in Mumbai!"
226,"Amazing. It was my first time to this hotel much less to India. I found my room very comfortable and calm. The view of the Arabian Sea was just lovely.  Lotus Cafe was heavenly. I truly enjoyed the Indian Cuisine section. I lost count of how many delicious portions that I ate. Service was expeditiously given with grace.  After a long day touring the city, I ordered a 2-hour massage downstairs at the Spa. It was just what I needed to unwind.  Comfort and calm as I stated above are what this hotel offers to the ultimate degree.   Anyone who rates this property less than 5 needs a reality check OR go to another hotel to give ‚Äúfalse‚Äù complaints for a compensation.  ..... Incredible India!"
227,"I stayed here for a conference. The rooms were booked thru the bonvoy website. The room that we picked was the one with 'lounge access'.   We arrived at the hotel and then spent 25 minutes waiting at the check-in counter for somebody to check us in. The person who finally checked us in was apologetic, that was the only saving grace in the check in experience.  The room was tiny, especially considering we'd picked a higher tier room. The rooms were clean as was the bathroom. No complaints there. Most rooms at the hotel would have a sea view.  The lounge was good, the staff courteous and the food decent (both in selection and quality). The view though was amazing. It overlooks the Arabian sea.  The gym at the hotel was well equipped and there were trainers available. There were"
228,"This Hotel is seriously Superb,lovely,wonderful and so maintained as per the international standards.Being a travel agent who booked hotels worldwide i can very well understand the standards and class of hotels and this hotel is beyond the expectations,came with family for wife birthday on 17 October and everything was perfect from BB to room to cleanliness to lovely reception staff to house keeping guys to pool guy to the ladies who gave access to toddler room everything was perfect and above all the Guest service lady Ms Sangita who made our day with the lovely cake and flowers,Thank you Sangita you are highly professional.  Regards,  Zakir Hussain Syed"
229,"My wife and I overnighted at J W Marriott Juhu from October 28 to October 29, 2019.  It appeared that the staff attrition has continued at this establishment in all departments including front desk and especially in the Lotus Restaurant.  This has resulted in considerable lapse in service.  As previously indicated, the pre-checked in guests still experiences considerable delays in getting their room keys as compared to the guests who do not use pre-check in.  Moreover, the recognition of the Ambassador Status during check in along with requisite perks have almost disappeared.  This perhaps might be due to more than normal flow of Bonvoy preferred guests checking in at this particular hotel.  Though this should not be a valid excuse for any Marriott property.  The only friendly"
230,"There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is immediately felt and puts the strangers at once at his ease.‚Äù Just a short note to say special thanks about such an enjoyable stay at your resort on 16th Oct 2019. I felt it very important to highlight the wonderful service and assistance offered by all your staff and guest relationship team. We had the exceptional pleasure of enjoying some wonderful time embraced by the warm hospitality of the Hotel J W Marriott Mumbai Juhu. We were very pleased by the charming atmosphere of your hotel, the hearty starting breakfast in the morning with a reasonable selection of hot and cold items and the always readily expected delicious dishes at lunch. Memories are the true treasure in a world of"
231,I have been coming to the JW Marriott since 2001. It has always exceeded expectations and continues to do so. I am a lifetime Titanium Elite member and happened to be there on my birthday this year in March. I was pleasantly surprised when a group of Marriott employees showed up at my door with cake and balloons and sang/wished me happy birthday. Made my day!! Time and again the rooms have been spacious comfortable and well kept. I was in an ocean view suite which is worth paying extra for and enjoying the breathtaking sunsets on Juhu beach. We love the Lotus cafe and the many restaurants on site. My wife and kids have thoroughly enjoyed the restaurants and checked them all out. Excellent cuisine and chefs! The onsite bakery and all of the spa amenities are great additions.
232,Room size exceeded our expectations as we stayed in the city before in similar price range but rooms were pretty small. Room was well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious with sumptuous variety from the buffet. We will definitely come and stay there again.
233,"First, Ms. Rashmi helped me a lot during my stay. Very friendly and humble and always met my needs.  She made my stay very satisfied.  Only dissapointing experience was transportation to airport. The driver asked for Tips during whole the drive. I gave him some rest IDR, but he showed very disgusting face to me. I forgot his name but he should be trained well under the JW brand."
234,"Right on the beach, a beautiful property in Juhu, I loved the stay there, 24/7 Cafe is great, as well as breakfast with live counter and lot of options is cherry on the cake. Almost all the rooms are sea facing"
235,Best hotel with good ambiance and food and staff behavior is very good and especially food quality and taste is awesome and good view from hotel and it's well decorated and constructed and buffet is just awesome
236,"Excellent F&B service by Mr. Ritesh and by concierge service by Mr. Noor. Great Reception desk service as well. Also, great communication with other hotel services (restaurant, pool area...). We were given an upgrade which included the Executive Lounge. Such a treat. Thank you J W Marriott Juhu, you have been superb"
237,I love this hotel I come here every single year. It is not very far from the airport. Good thing is its closer to Bandra where all the fancy good restaurants are. The hotel is GRAND literally. Large buffet area. The food is amazing
238,"JW Marriott Juhu is a must, whether it be for your entire trip or a simple transit, you must ensure it's included in your itinerary. The team including  the general manager Sharad alongside a special mention for chefs Alok and Tanmesh, also make our stay extra special each and every visit. What makes an entire stay special is every aspect of the hotel, so credit to all the staff for being so hospitable."
239,"We‚Äôve stayed in a lot of luxury hotels this trip but this is the only one where everything worked.  The staff are amazing, so friendly and cannot do enough for you.  We loved the huge pool where we had a relaxing day after much touring.  Will definitely be recommended this hotel to our friends.  We were given an upgrade which included the Executive Lounge.  Wow, what can I say?  High tea, drinks & canap√©s in the evening.  Such a treat. Thank you J W Marriott Juhu, you have been superb."
240,Thank you so the lovely staff at JW Marriott juhu Mumbai for making our stay super comfortable and memorable!! No wonder it is our favourite property and each time we visit it only gets better!! Thank you to Akshay for always taking care of us.. this is why we keep returning to JW Marriott juhu!! Gloria was fantastic.. happily engaged my kids while we relaxed at the lounge!! The food was so delicious thanks chef Ajay and Anil!! They have the most divine rooms/hotel.. delicious food and spectacular staff.. you will be so well taken care of!! A must do for anyone visiting Mumbai !!
241,"Stayed here on several occasions, and the reason is because it‚Äôs the best in Mumbai (in my opinion). Location is great, and service is next to none. Executive Lounge is a pleasure, and the general clientele is of a high standard. This hotel never disappoints. I shall return!!"
242,"great hotel right next to the Juhu Beach. Not a high Rise but great location, next to local designers and shopping area. Wonderful staff and nice service. we were very happy to have stayed there and will always be staying there."
243,"Though I have explored quite a few 5 star properties in Mumbai , the location and staff of Juhu Marriott is simply outstanding . I wish to mention Monica who took care of all our needs and tried to do every possible thing to make my daughter‚Äôs bday special .. firstly they upgraded my room with an amazing view .. then arranged for a pizza making session for my kid who thoroughly enjoyed it .. evening dinner had a melodious piano tunes to south down . Lotus cafe is one of the most coveted breakfast points in Juhu and lived up to its hype .. the live performance of tabla and other music maestros made the entire environment hypnotic .. It‚Äôs such an amazing hospitality that I am in complete awe of it"
244,I come back to this hotel whenever I‚Äôm in Mumbai.  Possibly my most favourite hotel to stay in.   The staff here are all outstanding and helpful. Service is in a league of its own. Food is outstanding. Rooms are great.  I can‚Äôt recommend a better hotel.
245,"It was our first time stay at J.W. Marriott,Juhu and it was exceptional.The Front Office staff was very polite, especially Tinku who was very much  humble and always had a smile on his face. He really impressed us a lot.  The food we had at Saffron was mind blowing, it was after a very long time that we had such a tasty food. Coming to Housekeeping, the room maintenance was very good with such an exceptional staff who did so much in a very less span of time. I would like to thank Abhijeet who made paper parrot and rabbits for my 6 year old daughter in no time in front of us. It was the first time that in all of our hotel stays in around the globe that a Housekeeping team impressed us using paper art instead of towel art which was new to us. I would like to thank Zeenat and Tinku"
246,"Very seldomly do I visit a lounge that gets it completely right. The food, view, staff, and fellow loungers all understand the point: enjoy our good fortune in life, eat, make new friends, and drain the cocktail hour that goes on for FOUR hours.  This is the happiest lounge I have ever been in, with everyone truly interested in enjoying themselves and not committed to silent, white folk austerity and silence. This a multi-cultural and generational group that tends to be devotees to this particular property in Mumbai. As someone who has stayed here 4 times, I completely understand the devotion.   Bollywood producers, drunken and overtanned 70-something British ladies, airline crews, generally awesome people, all congregate at cocktail hour to enjoy life and make new friends.  The"
247,Spent 3 nights at the hotel. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Sangita our guest services contact really looked after our needs and made our anniversary a special occasion. Al la carte dinner in The Lotus  cafe was wonderful- delicious food and great service.
248,"This hotel is extra special. Not because of the location, but because of the people that work there. Nothing is too much trouble - the team that work here, from guest relations, concierge, reception, the restaurant, the spa and housekeeping, every single person I came across willingly went the extra mile to make me feel like I was home away from home. That's why I have been staying here every year since 2003. Don't stay anywhere else!"
249,"An old saying what goes up comes down but should not be in the Hotel Trade,and this fine hotel has stooped to zero level within a year.The staff esp.the accts and other admin staff have to be really made to understand terms,of payments ,credit cards,pre auths taken etc. Their stupidity and reason of no knowledge made our teamleader miss a flight due to their delay for no concern as not aware of the situation and knowledge.Reported to GM who is not bothered. Anyway never a repeat at this hotel."
250,Where do you go for a solid buffet? the breakfast here. really it is so worth it. it opens at 6 AM and they have hot items most of the time ready to go. mix of indian and continental  worth it attendants helping can be a hit of miss though
251,"I stay here when I am working. It is like visiting family. It is a lovely hotel and where there are any issues the staff jump in to sort it. It has a wonderful position on the beach. On a personal level I would like to thank Rohit, JD, Amen,Sahil, Anil , Noor , the cafe, chefs and all the staff who work very hard. Food is delicious, and I have not found a better home from home. Susy"
252,this hotel is the best Marriott hotel I have stayed in. From check in to Check out every staff member greets you with a smiling face and makes you feel valued. I had a great time dining in the breakfast area where Mr. Satish and Mr.Gurvinder left no stone unturned to make me feel at home.  I will recommend JW Marriott Juhu to all the travelers looking for a hotel with the comfort of home
253,Beautiful property facing sea. Excellent view of the airport. Low flying planes to watch before landing. The rooms are spacious and have excellent view. The conference halls are massive and beautiful. The food provided at the buffet is good. Swimming pool is one of the finest. There is a jacuzzi built in the pool. The gym is also excellent. Lounge is also superb.
254,"The property is strategically located on Juhu beach, but the ambience inside the hotel is not upto the mark. The front desk is on the side not in plain view and the layout is confusing. The restaurant and meeting hall location is not laid out properly and not enough signage to guide. The room was good and clean. View from room was good but there were no windows or gallery to enjoy sea breeze. The toilets in the lobby and near meeting hall does not have water faucets a basic necessity for Indians using these facilities. Overall not a five star experience."
255,My stay was very comfortable. I usually visit India every 2 months and stay at JW Marriott Juhu. Jidnyasa helped me with connecting with few other regular members on the day I was off from work and had nothing to do. Her willingness and the offer to attend the bar event made me feel the hotel I would stay eveytime I visit to India to be able to attend the events after work.  Thanks!
256,"For me part and package of going to Mumbai is staying at my most favourite hotel, JW Marriott Juhu. There is a whole vibe about the place that makes you want to come back to JW Juhu again and again. The Lotus caf√© has its own buzz about it, whether its a superb breakfast you are after, cakes at tea time or a buffet dinner, you just cannot go wrong. Chef Alok along with his entire team always look after me so well. Executive Chef Himanshu leads his brigade with pride and the hotel excels every time when it comes to food and culinary desires. Noor at concierge is not only professional and consistent but he is always ready to help and assist with guest needs, Noor and the team go out of their way to organise your transport, luggage and travel plans and requests. Right from the time"
257,My husband and I stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu for 3 nights.  Not only was it a very easy and comfortable stay but the service was outstanding!  Jidnyasa  (Asst Customer Service Manager) and Front of house team including concierge provided outstanding service! The breakfast area was comfortably busy but very well managed and again the service was outstanding by all staff! I would highly recommend a stay here!
258,"On my recent visit to jw Marriott Juhu the stay was really fabulous and I had an great time, superb ambience and hospitality, I would like to specially thank Ms.Jidnyasa who took care of our room check-in and stay in an really profession manner and I am extreme happy with her service provided who was available 24*7 on calls for any assistance regarding checkin and also would thank Mr.Pritpal and Sahil Taneja and Ms.Zeenat. Even the ambience at lotus cafe and Mezo mezzo was really good. Looking forward to stay frequently at the property as usual."
259,"Had exceptional hospitality from JW marriott during my stay in mumbai, special call out for Yasmin Arfa (Guest Relations Executive ) for her hospitality and exceptional customer care. From checkin to checkout and during my stay yasmin took extra care to make sure that everything was in place to make this stay comfortable for me."
260,"Location was nicely located by Juhu beach. Facilities were clean and food was great. Special shoutout to Ms. Yasmin Arfa - who went above and beyond, acceding to my requests unlike others who went by the book. Her response via Whatsapp was extremely prompt. I felt comfortable and stress-free during my stay."
261,Felt like home coming at the JW Marriott Juhu Perfect arrangements could not ask for more  Thanks Ms. Rashmi Trivedi who took care of all minute details to make our stay joyful and comfortable Kudos to the courteous staff
262,"This hotel is one of our favourite hotels in the world.It has some of the best amenities, including a fantastic selection of restaurants,  a wonderful spa,& gym and a great executive lounge with spectacular views of the Arabian sea. The service provided by staff is second to none, always greeted with warm smiles and excellent hospitality from Managers to cleaners.. As always looking forward to our next visit.."
263,Mr Pravin Yadav at Spa is a very co operative executive .Pool and Spa Gym is nicely operated under him.Thanks for all his efforts  Hotel staff is also co operative  Property and Pool side is also amazing
264,Dhiraj and his colleagues make this an exceptional hotel. They are warm friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable about their areas. I highly reccomend this hotel. It has a great beach location and the bars and restaurants are superb.  There are also nearby bars and restaurants.
265,We stayed at this hotel and it was the first time visiting India for my freinds and the holiday started off really good. The staff were freindly and Excellent. Breakfast in the morning was excllent my freinds were amazed with the variety of food provided.
266,"After spending 10 days in Goa with my family, our last 2 nights in India concluded in Mumbai where we had an excellent stay at the JW Marriot in Juhu.  The hotel is conveniently located near to the airport which means you avoid the congestion of the typical Mumbai traffic which is ideal and practical for a short stay.  The hotel location in the Juhu Beach area is very lively and entertaining, buzzing with people and all kinds of vendors, stalls and shops where the local amenities provide all you need at a stones throw away.  The hotel itself is an absolutely beautiful property with a very grand, modern feel and an open, airy lobby. Very stylish decor and design are complimented by several impressive art works by well known artists.  Excellent options for restaurants in the hotel"
267,"My wife and I was at the JW Marriott Mumbai (Juhu) location in September 2019. We had a great time at the hotel and the beach view from the hotel was amazing. One thing worth mentioning is the thorough professionalism and follow-up from Mr. Luis Gomes, who is an associate at Guest Services. We had forgotten a backpack with IDs required for air travel while we left to the airport after checkout in a taxi arranged by the hotel. We left it in the taxi and had no way to contact the driver after he dropped us off at the airport. I called the hotel and Mr. Gomes helped us out by contacting the driver and making sure to send him back to the airport to deliver the backpack back to us, which made our air travel possible. I appreciate and thank Mr. Gomes's work; he went beyond our"
268,"Ladies & Gentlemen, my stay at JW Marriott, Juhu has been nothing short of utter bliss ! The dedication & commitment with which the entire staff of this premium hotel takes care of its guests, is simply incredible, right from the moment I checked in at the Reception till my adieu. I was greeted by Mr Abhishek & Mr Pascoal (Assistant Front Desk Managers) with a very charming welcoming smile & the gentlemen really ensured that the process of checking-in was gone through seamlessly. The moment I entered the Ocean-View room, I was mesmerized by its breathtaking view of the Ocean. All the rooms, I observed, are so arranged that one gets a clear and wide view of the Ocean through the glass. The room in itself had all the amenities, needless to say. I especially loved the ambiance"
269,"Loved this hotel!!! Firat time in Mumbai and wasnt sure where to stay. So glad we picked this hotel. Safe, secure, clean, modern, updated. Right on the beach with a beautiful view. Great breakfast buffet with lots of options, including great stuff for westerners like me. The chef even introduced himself and gave us great tips for selecting restaraunts. There are shops in the complex too to buy deserts, tea, icecream, snacks, rugs, jewelry, books, and other souvenirs. Absolutely loved this place. Its not in South Mumbai near most of the sites, but honestly very easy to get to. Concierge hooked us up with an awesome tour with car and tour guide for a very good price! Loved this place!!"
270,Interior of the hotel is Luxurious so ignore the outside!  The rooms are very comfortable and the only real complaint was some noise from the corridors late in to the morning. The food at the buffet restaurant is great for breakfast and the italian restaurant has great traditional pizza.  Location wise it was great for myself and only 20 mins from the airport.  I will most certainly return on my next visit.
271,"excellent Lounge service-friendly staff (Gloria), great food and great service, takes very good care excellent room Service-House Keeping staff takes great care for comfort, in heavy monsoon, my papers and shoes were completely wet, Staff took great care drying it in my absence"
272,"I travel 100+ days for work and Mumbai Marriott at Juhu is one of the finest hospitality and professional and well trained staff, in lounge, finest chefs incl Alok and at every restaurant including Lotus cafe."
273,"Right from the pick up till the check out every experience at Marriott Juhu has given us was over the top. We reached the hotel around 9 30 am, still we were given the room as an early check in without any additional cost. The front office was kind enough to give my daughter a cute welcome gift. Also we were upgraded to a premier room by Abhishek the accommodation manager, as a gesture in the evening which was a cherry on the cake. The complimentary access to the Executive Lounge as a package with the room proved to be very useful. It allows 24x7 access to it with Tea Coffee Snacks & happy hour drinks. All the room amenities were excellent. We also used the Swimming Pool which had a perfect location. We were also given a cake to celebrate my husband's birthday which was another"
274,"Apart from our yearly trip in February, we found ourselves again in JW Mariott Juhu this year, in July. An unexpected situation, an unplanned visit!  We were touched by the genuine warmth & concern shown by the much familiar to us, personnel there!  üîÖIn this context, the first name that I would like to give many thanks to, is  Satish Rajak, at Lotus cafe.  He made sure we were always comfortable.  His service, his loyalty to Marriott and commitment to his job, is outstanding and applaudable. üîÖAlso many thanks to Gaurav Batra, the front desk manager.  We were delighted to see him back at Juhu Marriott! Gaurav also goes out of his way to attend to the needs of the guests. üîÖChef Alok Verma.... his warmth &friendliness always adds pleasure to our stays! Very skilled chef too!"
275,This was my first time in Mumbai and chose the JW juhu property as it seemed to have the best location and facilities üòä. I was very pleased with my experience and was upgraded to an ocean view suite due to my status on Marriott bonvoy. Lovely chefs at the executive lounge as well as excellent service from the front and Monika and Abishek who went that extra mile. üòäüôåüèª
276,"I stayed at the J.W. Marriott in Juhu for the first time during a business visit of 3 nights to Bombay. Reached late night around 10 PM and Front Desk service was good in allocating room. In-Room Dining is something that changed my mindset about this property coz next day around 11PM when i came in post my event and i ordered food, the salad was stinking. Hence i didn't ordered anything and skipped my dinner. Honestly next day morning they were really apologetic about it and they really treated me well (Thanks to guest relations team) but yup my experience went for a toss."
277,"I stayed at the J.W. Marriott in Juhu for the first time during a business visit to Bombay.  The hotel isn't that far from the airport but given the traffic, you need to budget a fair bit of time. On my way out, it was raining in the morning and it took almost an hour and a half to get to the airport.  The hotel lobby is fairly large and it looks out to the sea. I arrived late evening and therefore had no issues getting my room.  The room itself was fairly standard with nothing that stood out. The size was decent. The decor was fairly plain and lacked any charm or warmth.  The King bed was comfortable and the airconditioning controls actually worked. There was a sort of functional work desk and chair that were not really suited for long hours of work. The mandatory flatscreen TV"
278,Great service; friendly place. Staff is every ready to help. Ishaan and company are very customer service oriented. Will certainly stay there again. We had one the best views of Arabian sea for the hotel suite. Thank you guys.
279,JW Marriott made my short holiday in Mumbai an extremely pleasant experience . The hotel was in a good location. i had a very comfortable room with a great view and the staff were perfect friendly and helpful
280,Japanese and Chinese follow English.  This hotel is very convenient for travelers because it beside the airport. I got a great experience from this Hotel when I visited in Mumbai. My airplane was delayed two hours and I arrived Mumbai at mid-night(00:30). But the Hotel concierge arranged a car for pick-up me skillfully. And help me to checked in very smoothly.

281,Excellent service by bijay and Sanjay also very good nature and behaviour I have recommended to both for upgrade and they do them job with very dedicatedly our event is goes good also MD present for whole day and observed it is discussed
282,"My colleagues and I visited the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu recently and were very impressed with the hotel, the food, and the friendly staff. Radhika in particular was incredibly professional, courteous and really made our stay special. We really appreciated all of her support.   We will definitely visit again when in Mumbai. Thank you!"
283,I had been to the hotel just now and Jain Paryushan is going on. I thought that to get the typical Paryushan Jain food may be difficult but to my surprise they served tastely pure jain food and that too very delightedly!! Prefer odd number room and probably you will have sea view!!
284,The stay at JW Mariott has been amazing! This property in Mumbai has always been a second home to me and my family. The service and staff at this prestigious property has always been top notch. The hospitality and gratitude extended to us during our stay  has made this trip indeed a memorable one. The staff is very courteous and I would like to take this opportunity to thank a few of them for their service and generosity. The service and the food from Lotus Cafe and In-room dinning has been excellent.   Chef Tanmesh Chef Alok Chef Amit  Chef Nakul Chef Rahul (Executive Lounge) Chef Ajay (Executive Lounge) Satish (Lotus Cafe) Akshay (Lotus Cafe) Joseph (In-room Dining) Michael (Manager - Housekeeping) Nandu (Housekeeping) Anil (Executive Lounge) Das  Alex (Executive Lounge)
285,I come for business but I really enjoy every bit in the hotel.   Room are fancy.   Food are very good   Stuff are good and super friendly.  And also near by some good restaurants. Also.  For business better choose this hotel and enjoy because the city is super super crowded I advise you to stay and enjoy the hotel.
286,"The stay at the hotel was superb and an amazing customer service.   I was here for a conference and a day‚Äôs stay. Somehow my luggage trolley was a little defective and during my travel via airport and at the bell desk, it did get broken. During my checkout, i still had a few hours to go for my flight and I provided my luggage to the cloakroom.   There I specifically mentioned the issue and to take care of my luggage to the bell boy. Ms. Zeenat at the front desk over heard the conversation and requested that The hotel can help me fix the trolley of my bag. She immediately called to fix the issue and within 2 hrs it was done which helped me at ease on my travel.  Many 5 stars do provide many different services, but such small gestures are always remembered when customer service is"
287,"First of all I am a corporate traveler spending about 4 months on international travel every year, doing about 50% of the travel in India. I have stayed at several JW properties in India including Chandigarh, Delhi Aerocity, Bangalore and Kolkata.  This stay has been very disappointing on multiple levels from beginning to end. I read somewhere a note from a hotel executive saying ‚ÄúAll of us at hotel endeavor to do all we can to ensure that every guest feels welcomed and received service that is friendly, attentive and timely.‚Äù I have to say that if your staff is doing all they can; then there must be a deeper issue at hand because I have experienced so many problems including not being picked up at the airport, being assigned a room at the very end of a long hall although my"
288,The entire staff at JW Mariott is very courteous and coordial. The hospitality extended to my family is beyond words. A memorable experience. I would rate their hospitality a 6/5.A big thank you to the team.
289,"Whenever i travel to Mumbai for business, my preffered place of stay is JW Juhu. I loved everything about this property including the support staff. Specially mention of Alok chef who really took great care and made me feel at home. Would luv to stay there for my future business trips."
290,"really loved the property ( with all the facilities) and the location., liked  the overall ambience. Breakfast  is excellent. hospitality offered  was superb, the sea view from the room especially in the early morning hours is the best part. I am club Marriott member and really appreciate the friendly welcome from the front desk staff- Rashmi & Tarun."
291,"Great location with views of the Arabian Sea and well laid out gardens.. Excellent ambiance, food & service.. It was my Wife Birthday & Our Relationship  Manager Yasmin attended to our every need and made the occasion a memorable one..!!"
292,"I am a Club Marriott member so I stay in the JW once a year. The location of the hotel is really good with great views of the sea and the Juhu beach.   Stayed there for one night and it was a great experience as usual. I was upgraded from the base category of suite to the Ocean View suite. The suite is quite spacious and the living room is very large with a massive window looking out on to the sea. The rooms are very well-equipped with all amenities and toiletries. The maintenance and upkeep of the hotel is great and this is amply reflected in the rooms as well.  The buffet at the Lotus Cafe is quite expansive and there is a mix from multiple cuisines which gives you ample choice.  In general, service levels at the front desk and at the restaurants have been of very high"
293,"Wish words can describe the hospitality of Team Marriott. Best compliment goes to the team leader GM Sunil, who has a fleet of amazing colleagues. If anyone wants to hold a marraige function or any event, please make sure to just head to JW Marriott, juhu.  The food was impeccable and the service of the Chef‚Äôs was amazing ... both Chef‚Äôs A really looked into minute details ."
294,"I took a day off was there for a one night stay, it was my birthday and i wanted to be myself, been club marriott member since years, visit hotel very often, visit lotus cafe very often. but stayed for the first time. The staff is so helpful & warm. Such a clean room & a stunning property facing the sky & ocean, from the security people to front desk to pool to spa, one of the best staff they have, love the pampering, very well trained. Love JW Marriott Juhu a lot.... Amit"
295,"Here right now and totally regret it. So when I reserved on the phone, they take a request for connecting rooms subject to availability. This was my most important priority and I was okay with understanding the availability scenario, as it is usually the process followed at all hotels. While checking in, Im told that the category of rooms that I booked do not have any connecting rooms at all. An hour after check in, when I request to change to any other category that has connecting rooms,  I am informed that the hotel is full. I am also informed  that the request for connecting rooms has not been recorded at all in the first place!  After all this,the noise from outside is like a truck's engine and shows no signs of abating. Reported it, and the staff just says we will check!"
296,"I stayed at this property for around 10 days, and by the end of it I did not feel like leaving. I had access to the executive lounge and this took my stay at the already wonderful hotel to another level. The staff there, Gloria Sahil Ajay Zion Anil Lydia Alex and a few more whose names escape my memory are such incredible hard workers and go that extra mile to ensure every needs of the guests are met and their stay is made memorable. From the food the chefs make, and the help the people at the desk provides, they do an incredible job. If given a chance, I would surely come back for the incredible staff that the executive lounge has."
297,"Staying at the Juhu JW Marriott was comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable  Staff and customer service was excellent for all the 4 days of stay  Special thanks to Head Chef Mr Alok who have been professional and friendly he gave personal attention to my mums healthy vegetarian needs. We enjoyed the personalised attention given to us  Had best time with my family"
298,"Stayed here for couple of nights and loved it. Nice rooms but the staff is something I would come back for. Right from the reception to the staff who clean my room, all of them were extremely nice. Went to their bar reflection one of the evening and enjoyed it. Shim, the bartender made some great cocktails for me. The sheer passion with which I saw here make my cocktails made me order more. A great asset for the hotel. Overall a very nice stay and will definitely stay again when in Mumbai."
299,The hotel is located on Juhu beach and has an amazing view of the beach. The staff is very helpful and courteous. The food is awesome. Breakfast buffet is huge and wonderful. Conveniently located around a lot of good restaurants and shopping. Easy to find transport to and from the hotel.
300,"Our stay was mainly booked to get away from Mumbai City rush and have a relaxing day at JWM. We received excellent service and personalised attention from various hotel managers at the reception, spa and Lotus restaurant. Most Staff were pro-active and courteous although our experience at dinner wasn't quite satisfactory."
301,"Mumbai & Monsoon , Rains the Hotel staff & Managment have been excellent  Spa , Rooms , Restaurants , Cafe  good to walk on the Beach early and experienced rain on the shores of Indian Ocean  Gym was excellent, Chef Amit, Alok and Head Chef , Reception. Rashmi  & Team  Managers Rohit , Shabaz waiters were responsible and ensured that they knew the Hotel residents and their preferences, Vegans please know that your needs are taken care off to request the Managment prior  relax and be happy"
302,"I would like to begin my review with a particular staff member at JW Marriot. Gloria from the executive lounge is the most heartwarming and beautiful person. She is very knowledgeable and caring which made my stay at JW very wonderful. My family and i looked forward to seeing her every single day and without her our trip would not have been the same. She is very smart and able to converse with guests so positively that i do not believe JW Marriot has given her a high enough position. Gloria is young and driven, she is exactly what JW Marriot Juhu needs."
303,"Probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Nevermind that check-in took too long. The manager more than made it up to me and my family. Rooms were superb. The service was impeccable. Only two issues with the pool. First, the pool was huge (which is a good thing) but it faced the beach which had a slightly unpleasant smell. Second, its a fairly public walk to the pool. You'd hope that it would be a little more private, away from well-dressed patrons walking around the hotel. If I'm ever looking for a hotel near the airport/beach, no questions, I'm staying here."
304,"What to say .... awesome excellent fantastic stay.  I had booked the Grand Ocean Suit , but they upgraded us to The Presidencial Suit free of cost. I loved the gesture from the hotel staff Mr. Shahbaz Kamal. Executive Lounge spread was excellent and yummy... the service staff at the lounge is so helpful and polite. All around the hotel the staff is so courteous. Clean hotel.  Breakfast spread is awesome... and the food is delicious and good. No words to describe the Presidential suit .... its awesome with the ocean view ... it was very spacious and comfortable.  In room dining food was good . Overall fantastic stay... My second stay at J W Marriot... I will surely visit again."
305,"It‚Äôs very rare you come across an experience which just blows your mind and remains one of the most memorable one EVER. Our stay at JW Marriott JuHU was an experience we will not be forgetting in a long long time and all for the right reasonS. The moment we checked in- Amen at the front desk made sure we were well taken care of. At the check out , Rashmi was absolutely brilliant. There wasn‚Äôt a single area that could have improved- from the team at the pool to the housekeeping and the experience at the restaurant (Mezzo Mezzo) - this was sure the best experience Ever. A big well done to the team who are so focused in delighting their customers. May be they should be sharing some best practices with some of the other properties who could definitely learn a tip or two on"
306,They must really work hard at training the staff. The customer service is superb and consistent throughout. Great breakfast and lunch at the restaurant. The EC is really outstanding for dinner. Internet is good. Highly recommended.
307,"I am a Bonvoy Gold Member and honestly every time I visit JW Juhu, I have noticed that buffet restaurant staffs have long face, are grumpy and least attentive to the customer. Yes, they do smile and laugh when they chat among themselves. Joining for the buffet is so unwelcoming at JW Marriott Juhu. I suppose they don't feel the need to serve as that must be the tone at the top. This really makes me think to drop Bonvoy membership and join someone else."
308,"I stayed at the JW Juhu July end thru August 4th. The hotel and its ambience is amazing. Given monsoon season I had doubts about what our experience would be like but Fortunately from the time I checked in as a elite member to check out the one thing which stood out was the customer service at the JW. I had work to do so was out a lot but the family was always taken care of.   Gaurav, Rashmi and entire front desk & concierge staff (especially Noor) were awesome and extremely caring to me and my family. We had four rooms and they knew all of us by our last name - constantly greeting us and ensuring we were taken care of.   They went over and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. They took care of all of our needs including arranging medicines from pharmacy to even getting an new"
309,"Stayed as part of my work as airline crew, The hotel is like a palace in many ways and you can just stay there and not even go out... have to give credit to all the wonderful staff especially Kevin and Pankaj who work in the lobby restaurant who are very nice and polite."
310,"Its a very well connected Hotel, Comfortable Room Stay, Great food offerings, Especially the Breakfast is well spread and from multiple cuisines.   Located just at the beach and have walkaway to lead you towards the beach, only the area around the Hotel is kept clear otherwise the beach is not would stepping out for.  I am at 4th Floor, Non Smoking Room."
311,"As with most hotels in India, the staff was very kind.  They were always willing to help with anything at all.  I took advantage of the laundry service.  The grounds were quite nice and well maintained.  The pool was cleaned, and used even in the light rains.  There is very good beach access.  I walked south to the jetty (about 1.4 miles, I believe), observing cricket matches everywhere (great fun to watch!), and then north up to Juhu and around that neighborhood (and the temple).  It was a total of about 7 miles of sight seeing.  Food in the Lotus restaurant was good and diverse, representing multiple cultures.  I had breakfasts and a dinner there.  The bakery, where I had a lunch and a dinner, sold unique sandwiches; I recommend it.  Wonderful Indian musicians played much of"
312,"I think I‚Äôve had the perfect stay and a beautiful warm welcome by every staff member of the hotel and specially this lady Yasmin Arfa, I have never been so overwhelmed with a such a great hospitality ."
313,We celebrated my husband's birthday by staying one night at JW Marriot Juhu. Their hospitality standards are par excellence. Right from check-in desk to check-out the concerned representative is waiting to receive u and help us with our next step. One feels very wanted and taken care of by the hotel staff. Monica at the reception was very warm to us and escorted us right upto the escalator along with the room key. Any query is attended very promptly and all depts viz Spa n restaurants call u to make reservations for you. The best experience was at Saffron restaurant where chef Sunil converted a complain into an appreciation. We were not happy with the lukewarm food and the non butteted breads. He personally came to our desk and changed the dishes to our satisfaction and again
314,"This JW is wonderful.  The service is extraordinary.  The executive lounge offers great amounts of delicious food with wonderfully attentive service from the waiters and chefs.  My room is on the third floor.  The housekeeper is Nandu.  He keeps my room immaculate, and makes fabulous towel animals.  I love his professional demeanor.  I just hate to have to checkout."
315,"I travel a lot to India for work and have always preferred to stay at Juhu Marriott when in Mumbai. The property is just beautiful (if I compare to other JW's in India), location is just perfect (right on the beach) and most importantly the staff. You can not beat the hospitality you get here compared to any JW's. Each member of staff is excellent from Shabaz Khan (front desk manager) who gives you the most warm welcome and the most comfortable room to make your stay a pleasant and comfortable on. Rashmi and Zeenat both do the same as well and Chef Alok Verma who is a great cook and will take special care of your dietary needs to make sure to cook anything you ask for. Lastly I want to thank the Executive Loungue team for hosting Gloria and the team (Alex, Ronnie, Pradeep and"
316,"From the entrance through to the pool, this is one of the best Marriott family properties I have stayed at, largely due to the amazing service of every single person I encountered. Extremely well located, with easy access to the beach and Juhu Tara shopping, and even a short walk to Bandra  Despite arriving from a 6am flight, the front desk staff gracially found me a room that I could check into right away for a much needed nap. Every meal I had at both Lotus Cafe and Saffron was delicious, and I appreciated the helpful suggestions from staff.  Rooms are a little bit dated and small, but everything else about my stay was A+"
317,"Staying at the JW Marriott Juhu elevated this visit to Mumbai. Personal and professional service from start to finish. They picked us up at the airport. The Breakfast on the LL has multiple live stations. Best breakfast I've had at a hotel in India. Luis, the concierge, suggested several nice restaurants. I was especially impressed with the seafood restaurant Mahesh Lunch room, and it's easily walking distance. Gaurav came to find us in the executive lounge to congratulate us on our extra successful business this week in Mumbai.   Overall a wonderful experience   Thank you"
318,"We were lured by the official photos and wanted to stay by the seaside, away from hustle and bustle of Mumbai's downtown. Our stay was on Feb. 12th-14th. Unfortunately the beach and sea water was very dirty (not hotel's fault) but the beautiful looking swimming pool experience was even more disappointing - when you exit the building out to the pool grounds you are met with a strong urine smell and hundreds of pigeons flying around and bathing in the swimming pool. Service-wise it was a disaster too. The higher rank were the employees, the more appealing service became. It started with a very cold check-in. On the second day of our stay, I saw some suite rooms availability and politely asked if an Elite Member upgrade would have been possible. The bored Club Lounge desk"
319,Fully enjoyed our stay at this property last weekend.  Thanks to the staff who took care of every small request and tried everything possible to make it special for us. Especially Rashmi was very responsive and took good care of our requirements.  The location is excellent and property has access to Juhu beach.  Breakfast at Lotus Cafe can be better managed especially on weekends with high rush. But the restaurant manager Mr. Patro and the chef were open to feedback and hopefully should improve upon small areas of concern.  Toddlers room needs improvement.  We really liked the live music being played at Lotus Cafe during breakfast.  Access to the executive lounge was useful as well.
320,"For the price, this could compete for one of the best JW properties globally.  Fantastic service that never misses a beat, and very comfortable accommodations.   As with many properties the executive lounge is a key experience (Arti, Shuchi and the entire team are fantastic), but if you can include even just the free breakfast, then you won't be disappointed.  The breakfast is vast and delightful.    For this stay, the stand-out experience was Zeenath my assigned Ambassador - made the trip.  She ensured that my room was perfect upon checkin (which included a quick room change to avoid a walk down a hallway that used to host prior smoking rooms...and she was amazing in pre-check in collaboration for car service, timing and overall made my experience a notch better than virtually"
321,I stayed for 3 days and it was a gorgeous hotel with stunning gardens and a view of the sea. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the buffet for breakfast was fantastic. I would highly recommend an omelette at the egg station which after ordering is then brought to your table for you. Service is second to none. The on site cafe/ sandwich shop is amazing I had the smoked salmon and avacado on toasted rye bread with a side of crisps and it was so nice. The coffee and tea is good too.
322,"As soon as you walk in you get a feeling of welcome and hearth. The hotel is beautiful decorated and the staff are always looking to do whatever they can to make your stay most enjoyable, including always greeting with a smile and namaste. There was a bit of a smoke smell in the hallways, however, the smell did not penetrate once inside a non-smoking room. The facilities themselves are state of the art, including the spa, gym and pool areas; and the dining as well from the buffet restaurant to the small cafe that serves coffees, pastries, breakfast items, sandwiches, etc.   Overall my stay was very enjoyable and I would definitely be back should I return to Mumbai."
323,"Great and amazing hotel, nice location, fantastic and delicious breakfast with traditional music , very helpful staff special Mr anil, beautiful ocean view and golden sends beach, amazing swimming pool, I really enjoy it this hotel."
324,I have been staying at JW Juhu for 4 weeks now and have to admit that the staff here is top notch. Absolutely loving the experience - thanks to Chef Alok and FOM Rashmi for being stellar on the job. Chef Alok cooks some amazing dinner meals for me each night and I'd come back to the hotel just to eat his food!  Highly recommended this place
325,"Stayed here for 6 days and must say this 5 star hotel gets 5 Stars from me. Except for an initial hitch, wherein the room they put me up was not in the best state, it had been a fabulous stay at this property. They made up for this by shifting me to a better and higher grade room immediately. The front office staff was very hospitable and obliging, making my stay ever so pleasant.   The staff at Lotus Cafe ensured that I had a wonderful start to every morning of my stay there with their cheerful and indulgent service. They do make me miss my morning breakfast at Lotus Cafe. Was impressed by the affable & charming Mr Gurbinder, who served me there. As also with the very amiable hostess Ms Anjali. The chef there Mr Amit Kocharekar, acceded to my request and went out of his way to"
326,"Recommend by family to stay here, the location is ideal for shopping in the heart of Mumbai. Staff are exceptionally attentive, and learn to know who you are. The food is some of the best hotel food ive ever had."
327,Overall happy with the stay and the hotel. This is my 3rd stay at the hotel and the facilities are great. Only slight complaint this time was my room was right at the end of the corridor and checkin seemed to take forever
328,We had an amazing experience at the JW Marriott in Juhu Mumbai. We were greeted from the moment we arrived and within minutes we were in our room. Jignyasa a manager at front desk made our stay extremely memorable. She understands customers and the hospitality industry. We travel to many 5 star hotels across the world but she definitely is one in a million. She is extremely professional and if there is any problem she has a suitable solution. She must be commended for her dedication. We will definitely recommend the hotel and will be back very soon.
329,"JW Marriott- The Name says it all. It's a 'Brand' and quite a Brilliant one. The property in itself is so mesmerising. The word Luxury definitely does justice to this hotel. The staff at every corner is so courteous and so professional. I've never seen even once, the staff not smiling. Everybody had a smiling face and the greetings were special. Since, I've failed to find any Cons in this palace of a place, I'll start with all the Pros:-  - Impeccable Security Checks at the Entrance Gate. - Smooth Security at the Lobby Entrance. - Staff very professional. - Genuine and Warm Greetings. - Yummy Welcome Drink. - Fast Check-in process. - Meet and Assist. - Rooms are big and lovely. - Quiet Rooms on the upper floors. - Swimming Pool Areas with a beach view- Amazing. - In house restro"
330,"I stayed here recently on business and the staff was property was amazing. The television was aggravating as it always defaulted to the default Marriott channel, was too loud by default and the remote worked poorly. Just a little frustration as I like to watch the news as I would prepare for the day. The food was wonderful and made fresh. Clean water was ready for me every time I returned to my room."
331,"Excellent atmosphere, helpful staff and lovely breakfast ! Would love it even more if I could enjoy the sauna etc for which I did not have enough time !  Front door staff were very friendly and welcoming!"
332,Well location near sea side everything is nearby you wanted for holiday staff are very good food is very good thanks  to Abhishek and Sahir very helpfully surround by good Restorent in side with all u need
333,"Right from entering and checking in till check out everything is perfectly managed with very Graceful  and Courteous Guest handling staff like Mr Rohit Tiwari , Mr Gaurav , Ms Rashmi Trivedi , Ms Srushti , Ms Snehal , Mr Pascol . In the Fitness Centre and Spa Mr Zahid , Neeraj , Mahesh and Ms Karuna assistance was very helpful . Excellent . Keep it Up ."
334,"The hotel itself was fantastic - from the room itself, to the pool, spa, and on-site restaurants, but what stood out for me was the excellent guest services. Two people went out of their way for us: Jindnyasa Mahajan, the guest relations manager, gave us her personal phone number before we checked in, and arranged cake and wine in the room to greet us when we arrived. Sachin Padlekar, the restaurant manager, overheard me ask for avocados at the breakfast buffet (which wasn't available) and arranged it especially for me (without me even asking!). The waiter who served us drinks at Dashanzi replaced the espresso martinis we ordered when we complained about the taste. Every single staff member was extremely courteous and helpful.  I'd highly recommend Mezzo Mezzo, the Italian"
335,"Monika was very humble with us and she helped us in our payment problem where as their was another girl named as rashmi,she was very rude as well as she was not at all happy in helping us for our queries.."
336,"the girl(rashmi) who assist me at the time of check in, was very rude in behavior as we were not dressed well up,,so she thought that we were not educated and we are poor who can't afford the hotel and no manners she have ,we know are affordable height, that's why we had gone to Jw Marriott hotel, Monica was calm enough and she was very humble and helped usand assist us in a very good manner.."
337,"One of the most amazing Marriott properties I have stayed in. To top that up, very keen to call our the names of two employees who went out of their way to make our trip super super special. Ms.Zeenat Bangi and Mr.Tinku Gupta !! It is associates like these who actually help build a brand even more than just the actual physical property!! Clearly, the only reason I come back to the Marriott properties are because of your great staff !! Make sure you continue to invest in the right talent like you are doing with these two lovely examples and this will ensure the Marriott brand is high up flying and the preferred brand!!  Will surely recommend this property.  Thanks and hope to make a visit once again soon."
338,Really enjoyed VERY much.Specially the staff member MONIKA SAINI gave    us a VERY SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY CAKE WHICH MADE MY DAY SPECIAL .I really had a great time with my spouse .The hotel has such a nice ambience that one really don't feel like leaving it
339,"Juhu Marriott mumbai is my favourite hotel to stay there! This was my third visit there.. Amazing property, amazing staff! Being an Elite member I have always been upgraded to a room which I loved. Waking up to the beach view from your room in s metropolitan city is a blessing! You feel energised the entire day!! Would like to mention Zeenat who has been incredible in her hospitality! Right from morning to night, taking care of my small needs in the hotel, she never made me feel away from home! The food is awesome! The spa and jacuzzi are awesome ! It‚Äôs an ideal place to stay for a business trip or even for a staycation! Hope to see u guys again soon   Cheers, Moushumi"
340,From the moment you walk in you feel very special in the care of the guest relations team.  They make sure all aspects and every detail of your stay exceeds your expectations.  I would not hesitate to return on my next trip- absolutely fantastic stay.
341,"Room services were great and room service personnel are professional. Room overlooking swimming pool and Ocean provided excellent refreshing view Hotel amenities are excellent Hotel location provides easy walk to beach, shopping and entertainment  Hotel restaurant and caf√© food choices, taste and catering services are best"
342,"I had a fantastic fortnight at JW Marriott, where all the hotel staff where amazing, in particular the Guest Relations Associates who looked after my every need. Zeenat and Amen in particular were instrumental to my stay here and made it extremely enjoyable.  There were a great range of restaurants, which was one of the key reasons for staying here, in particular Priyanka and the team at Mezza Mezza were superb.  My room was ideal and felt like I had an extremely comfortable stay here. The cleaning staff were very impressive, in particular Paras who looked after me for the majority of my stay here.  I would fully recommend anyone to stay at the JW Marriott Hotel, and will certainly be visiting again!"
343,"We stayed 5 nights for a TV conference, and booked another 5 nights on our own dime. The service at this hotel is absolutely exceptional. Perhaps the best we've ever encountered. We are Titanium members, but the staff at JW Marriott Juhu every day went above and beyond to treat us like royalty. I have nothing but extraordinary things to say about this hotel:   1. For folks who are calling from out of India, like others, I had trouble getting someone to answer the phone, but when I sent a tweet, Ishaan the manager called me within 5 minutes. From there it was smooth sailing. He even gave me his mobile, when I expressed concerns about our early arrival time.   3. We booked the hotel's car service to and from the airport, about 45 USD each way. The car, driver, service were"
344,"The place lived up to the expectation one has from JW. For me the highs in this stay were a few details: 1. In today's age when music we listen to is mostly electronic the live sessions both at breakfast and dinner were a refreshing change. The sitar, tabla and piano being among my favourite instruments these enhanced my mealtime experience. 2. Loved the flower arrangements across the place in pink, lilac, purple, violet etc.  3. When I was asking for guidance on the way to the beach one of the staff members standing nearby not only walked me there but later on also enquired if I had returned back safely to my room.  4. Improvent suggestions were addressed immediately."
345,"I have recently stayed at the property due to a small scale business event we held on site and my expectations have completely been met. The banquet team did a great job and the half day event went very well, food was good, A/V equipment on point.  I overall spent 3 days at JW Marriott Juhu and thoroughly enjoyed the very comfy room, great food options and eventful pool area.  Juhu is generally not my go to area to stay in Mumbai due to its high congestion and not very strategic location if you‚Äôre in Mumbai for business. However I definitely do think I will be back."
346,"Excellent hotel, the interiors, executive lounge & morning breakfast. The pool & the lawn right next to the sea, have a pleasant feel to them. Plus the beach access from the hotel is an added attraction. The staff are all very courteous, & I am especially thankful to Ms. Zeenat, who arranged for the complimentary Lounge Access after check-out, while I had to wait a few hours before heading to airport."
347,"Zeenat Bangi made my stay so wonderful.  First she found me an eraser to help me make backings for my ratings! So creative and saved my outfit, as without earrings I gelt undressed. Then she personally wrote a note and delivered my favorite wine as I am a Marriott member and she acknowledged that.  I love Marriott hotels because it hires great people to work here!  Ltripp"
348,"Ok i must confess i am a fan and an elite member of the Marriott hotel chain. Marriott juhu is a good hotel, but it is becoming dated and threadbare in places. It certainly doesn't reach the 5* level.  My arrival was on a Friday evening and the entrance was busy. All baggage has to be scanned by security prior to entry into the hotel. Unfortunately as it was so crowded no one helped with the bags or assited us.  Check in was smooth and professional, but we were left to find our own way to our room carrying our bags.  Rooms are small, but clean as and tidy. TV didn't work and the alarm was showing the incorrect time. Both faults reported and fixed.  Best part was the plug sockets are international so no adapter required.  Hotel bar was good, staff pleasant and attentiv. The"
349,Very nice hotel with a great pool area and access to a stretch of the Juhu beach. As an elite member the Executive lounge is very good.  Only disappointing thing was the amount of noise in the corridors between 11:00 and 02:00.  People seemed to want to shout out the rooms and the sound proofing didn't seem to have much impact.
350,"My fav hotel in Mumbai.  Stayed here more than 20 times. -Centrally located -Best Beach View -Amazing swimming pool -Luxury modern rooms  -My fav room is 501 (Presidential Suite), this room won't let you step outside. -Food is 9/10  #mustvisit"
351,A gorgeous location with everything you might ever want in a hotel. The included breakfast buffet makes it even better with the endless variety of food choices with the only thing lacking was the quality of the omelets. All other choices were top notch.
352,I stayed in J W Marriott Juhu Tara Road mumbai i would give 10 out of 10 for every thing becouse becouse it has everything one can expect in return for values infect it does more. If you have not stayed  in Marriott Juhu then you u need to make one more trip to mumbai to see what you had missied in past it is home for bollywood celebraties if u are filmy home for oriantal food if you are food lovers security comfort livelihood entertainment u just name it is there . Last line just go to JW Marriott nd join me as Fan of hospitality masters.i m sure u will just love it like my grand child who is 8 nd will come mumbai india only if it JW MARRIOTT JUHU TARA ROAD IF NOT THEN HE IS NOT INTERESTED AT ALL.long lasting memories for everyone .Enjoy your stay ..Hasim bham hackney north
353,Staying here for business thinking it would be a good hotel with all the services I need.  It's very impersonal and the rooms are quite small and it was very noisy!  Could hear everything in the corridor and other rooms.  They have lots of events in the basement leading to very busy atmosphere.  Room service took over an hour to arrive after taking 20 minutes to get through to them.  At times I felt like I was in a Vegas hotel.  Also they have a terrible pigeon problem.
354,Stayed here for a night recently. The hotel‚Äôs location is unbeatable. It is right on the beach and has amazing views from many rooms. The overall ambience is great also.   The breakfast is good but somehow the selection was not as good as other JW I have stayed at in India. The rooms do show the age. They are sufficient for the purpose though.
355,the check in and check out procedure very smooth.Food is amazing The staff was very polite and humble .The lotus cafe was also very amazing.Best place of this hotel is pool site and specially evening or night just see the sky and feel relax and feel the wind.
356,"As far as the check in and check out procedure was concern, it went very smooth. Food was amazing and being a platinum elite member the room got upgraded as well to a studio suite. The staff was very polite and humble The lotus cafe was also very amazing. Overall i had a wonderful experience and hope to see you soon"
357,"Good location by the beach , great service but rooms are smaller as compared to other JW Marriot hotels , food is great and service is excellent . Good hotel for family vacations . Breakfast and Dinner buffets are good."
358,"Normally I do not get to stay at this hotel , as I am from Mumbai . I have, though , had multiple meetings and meals at this hotel.   So , this time when I decided to have a staycation at this hotel with my family , I was looking forward to the same. I had made my booking through my club Marriott membership and booked a suite because of that . Apart from that I booked one more room .   This is one of the busiest hotel in Mumbai and it was sold out due to group bookings. I had requested for an couple of hours early check in , though the rooms were not ready at the time of check in , so we were given access to club lounge ,while we waited. While booking both the rooms I had updated my Bonvoy Platinum elite number, though for some reasons the booking system at the hotel did not"
359,"I stayed at this hotel twice before, and on my last review, I wrote that I hope that I can return to this hotel again. I love JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu.  Yes, I JW Marriott Juhu. Front desk, rooms, breakfast, lunch, dinner, pool, garden and conference facilities are top notch. For me, everything works well, actually super well. The service level is excellent!!! I also got a feel for jogging and walking along the beach early morning before breakfast, along with hundreds of locals."
360,"Stayed for 2 nights in the Premier Club room, which offered great view of the Arabian Sea.   The service at the hotel is par excellence, always with a personal touch.   We thoroughly enjoyed the Mother‚Äôs Day brunch, which offered great selection of food.  Swimming pool is nice, clean and appealing; with the only hind side that they don‚Äôt serve cocktails near the pool area (though the choice of mock tails is available)."
361,"I started visiting this Property before it officially opened up in 2002,  (and for at least 2 years while it was being constructed) and waited anxiously so we could stay there once it opened up. Sure enough from 2002 until 2019 including  our visit a week ago, this flagship JW has been our Home whenever we have visited India (including 2008 when we were probably only one of a handful of guests and had to walk in and up those long stairs while tight security  was in place). We have visited during all seasons including New Year‚Äôs Eve and seen several GMs, beginning with European/US ones and now thankfully locally based  senior experienced GMs like its present GM Sharad Puri, who in my experience is the best GM to date, in terms of his leadership, commitment to service and quality"
362,"JW Marriott Juhu,what to say about this property.whatever said is less.scores perfect in all aspects. Be it ambience, decor,hospitality,guest services,location,restaurants( Lotus cafe,Mezzo Mezzo,BBC,Reflections,Dashanzi,Saffron),SPA,Gymnasium,Pool,access and walk on the beach,service,attitude of staff, engagement and helpful behaviour of management,upkeep of rooms,Internet services,Marketing team,Club Marriott and much more. you are given a warm welcome from the moment you enter the hotel and warmth continues from check in, to stay and until check out and departure leaving behind memories to cherish for lifetime.  Special mention of the view from the executive lounge and its Dynamic Manager Mr.Sahil Taneja and all lounge staff for their excellent services.  A big applause for"
363,I had one of the best stays at the Jw mariott juhu . Gaurav Batra and Akshay at the front office are really amazing hosts taking care of all my needs and requirements. Ruchira is also very helpful and kind. Overall the front office staff is simply amazing. An outstanding team. Good food at saffron restaurant and the chef is really good there. The chef made good dishes I relish.
364,Had a great stay at JW Marriott Juhu. Our stay was made very comfortable specially by Mr. Tarun. he really took good care of us made sure that we were happy during our stay . The food and service at Saffron was very good .
365,"The quality of the food at the Lotus Restaurant is amazing.  The personal interest taken by the Chefs in particular Alok, Amit and Stanley is commendable.  Chef Alok personally met us every time we had a meal to make food that suits our dietary requirements.  This was amazing.  The staff in restaurant Shrikant and Sideesh provided superb service     Lotus is my favourite restaurant as they have a good spread of food to suit everyone.   Even the staff at the Front Desk were so helpful and efficient, in particular Gaurav, Alshaya, Manisha, Suchi and Saif.  Sneha In sales was  helpful prior to us checking into the hotel.  The BBC coffee shop had amazing pastries and Imran and Sachin were really helpful.   Definitely recommend the hotel."
366,Part of the club Marriott a staycation close to home . Excellent pool and gym. Good beach facing room though compact very self sufficient . On the beach side facing you feel you are at a holiday destination oblivious of the fact that on the other side is the road and bustling city
367,"I had received an email from guest relations asking me to review my stay; so here is my review. I spent the weekend at the JW Marriott Juhu. I wish I had had the same experience as some of the other reviews, but sadly, the experience was not what I have come to expect while staying at a JW Marriott. I had taken advantage of using a few suite vouchers and requested early check-in (1pm and arrived 1:30 pm). Upon check-in I was told my room was not ready, but I could wait in the lounge, as it was only going to be 45 minutes. I was given the option of checking into another room, but for 45 minutes I did not see the sense of the staff having to clean a room for a such a short stay. I proceeded to wait in the lounge for 2 hours, and at no time did any one update me as to when my room"
368,"My wife and I live in Mumbai but celebrated our anniversary by staying here. From the moment I dropped the car off with the complimentary valet parking to the time we left, we were given the ""royal treatment"". I mentioned the reason for our visit at check in and immediately my wife was presented with flowers. Then shortly after checking into our room (they changed our room to be closer to the beach and have a better view) we were presented with a cake and a bottle of wine to celebrate. Every request was met with an immediate friendly response. While we were sitting by the pool, the attendant brought us water to drink - we didn't even have to ask for it. We have stayed at the JW a few times in the past, and our current experience was every bit as good as our previous experiences."
369,It's a good restaurant in mumbai as well as taste of food is also awesome.. 2-3 days back I had waffles at breakfast they were absolutely fabulous .I must say Chef Ashish is one of the talented chef and as well as an artist I had ever met.
370,"Fantastic hotel by the beach, resort style, great rooms and food. Very good service especially by Zeenat at the front desk. Reccomend walking along the beach to check out Razzberry Rhinoceros for a drink."
371,Nice hotel  Nice service Hotel food is too good Hotel staff behaviour is soo good & cute Hotel back side beach is very clean  Very Amazing experience  Too good  There is such a place in life once in life Nice experience üëç
372,"Stayed in the hotel during a business trip during May 3-5, 2019. Hotel was good as one can think but rooms very really very small and reminded me of Europe.   Swimming pool was maintained. Breakfast has too much of variety and staff were prompt in service.   Location of the hotel is great and is just by the side of Juhi Beach."
373,"This Hotel is excellent and very elegant, it‚Äôs reminded me with Swiss Hotel Istanbul -  Bosphorus, the staff were extreme helpful and very high quality of hospitality, the hotel and rooms are very clean, the staff helped to do early check in.  Highly recommended hotel"
374,"The service at this hotel is fantastic!  As others have noted, the Executive Lounge is great along with the buffet breakfast.  The spread is a bit ridiculous (but in a good way).  The property itself is well maintained and tastefully decorated.  Kudos to Monika who made me feel at home at the hotel."
375,"Hi Karan,  Just wanted to take an opportunity to thank you for all your hospitality and services 24x7. My event was a great success. Food was good and on time, staff was cooperative.  Hope to get the same in near future as well.  Thanks"
376,"I have been coming to Marriott every week from last 6 years for a business meet & have been coming to eat at the lotus cafe, Arola, dashanzi & even BBC from past 30 years , I might have stayed zillion times with with you guys be it ur juhu property or around the world.  JW MARRIOTT JUHU is going from good to bad & bad to worst with respect to ur valet service over the years. Seems u guys are just outsourcing/hiring drivers from temporary company with out any training and quality check. Arrogant, untrained, indiscipline valet drivers. I wud not want to name the driver get him in trouble, but it‚Äôs annoying at 7am in the morning to over hear him telling other valet driver, I unquote the exact words * yeh gaadi ka chabi mat Lena aur usko Bol gaadi aage leke aane ko phir chaabi"
377,"Me and my family have been visiting this hotel from past 14years, every time i visit this property the warmth shown by the hotel staff i feel like i am meeting my Family members. The food is amazing, the chef will customize menu according to your taste, the hotel got a great view of Juhu Beach. I want to thank Mr.Ishan Malik under his leadership i could also see a great positive change in the team. Front office staff will always go out of the way to meet our preference's."
378,"I travel to Mumbai twice a year and only stay at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu. As a guest they are always attentive and kind. But further to that, when I host events in their space, their team is keen on details in a way that allows me to relax and not worry over how the food will taste, how the room is set up for my guests, and how everyone will be received by the hotel. The experience starts with Rasika Kalbande, the Senior Sales Manager  all the way to the floor staff like Bhavesh who stepped in and assisted with set up when I ran out of hand myself. If you're looking for a nice place to stay, you can't go wrong with this hotel. If you're looking for an amazing place to host an event, the staff really make it the best choice!"
379,"Only one thing to say that front office staff name Mr Abhishek is very rude and aggressive to guest,infront of me,he shouted to guest which is totaly unexpectable. Housekeeping staff Mr jorden,Mr vishal,both are very cooprative and understood the need of guest."
380,"Massive Property, well maintained Great Service, However not as personal as other smaller properties (we checked in here after having stayed at the Taj exotica in Goa). Special mention to Hasmeet and Shabaz at the reception.  Smaller Bedrooms but we were upgraded to the club rooms which were slightly larger. Great spread at breakfast. Did not use pool or other facilities so cannot comment or rate these."
381,Been in & out of this one ever since it opened I think 15+ years ago. Large - I'd say somewhat efficient - helpful staff - nicely laid out rooms despite the space constraints. Breakfast is a fight as pretty much everywhere across the country (India). Struggle for attention. Bar is small & nice - could do with better training to the staff - or I wasn't lucky to get the right man for the job. After a bit of struggle we figured what we wanted from each other (Barman & I). The hotel is perpetually crowded - due to location it garners an above average footfall - some desired - a whole lot undesired (from hotel's perspective) leading to a certain buzz which appeals to many. If you are looking for a quiet stay - this isnt your pad. If you are looking for Buzz - look no further. Its
382,"It is located right on Juhu Beach, one of the best location in Mumbai, with excellent view of Arabian Sea. Being a Club Marriott member, I utilized my free night stay on a weekend. The check-in was very smooth. Alpa at front desk was very helpful. She not only gave me an early check-in but also the room of my choice on higher floor, thanks. The hotel has a lot of facilities like gym, spa, big pool and some shopping beside nice bars and restaurants. The executive lounge was very good though they could not serve liquor due to dry day. We used the pool for pretty long time in the evening. The food and service was excellent in Mezzo Mezzo and Lotus Cafe. The check-out again was very smooth thanks to Shabaz. No doubt it is number one hotel in this part of Mumbai. Normally I have"
383,I just spent 2 nights at this hotel. Great space with a nice set of food restaurants. The swimming pool is quite big and there is a direct access to the beach. The rooms are ok but very business like and you can unfortunately hear your neighbors.
384,"I recently stayed at JW Marriot Juhu Beach, Mumbai for a week. Having stayed in some of the best named hotels over the years, i can honestly say that this stay was one of the best i have experienced from a 5* hotel. The staff were excellent and always willing to go the extra mile, especially the guest liaison officer who was called Zeenat. She was absolutely amazing. She even arranged a surprise birthday cake for my daughters 6th birthday! I will definitely stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it."
385,The five star rating is about its accessibility. as you go to the main entrance of JW you can handover your car to the valet parking I had been for a Buffet lunch (1700 rs per person)for which I had to go down from the lobby in the lift also they have a salon called kroma kay which can be accessed by the lift obviously it's a five star property so it is accessible but I did not know that there was a lift to go to the spa...
386,This place is locate at a prime location in Juhu. I was there last September and the view from the hotel is just too good. It faces the Arabian Sea and you can see the Infinity pool. Coming to the breakfasts they have a wide spread of Indian and Continental and its too good. Its a lovely crowd. Had a amazing time and looking forward to visiting this lovely hotel again.
387,"The JW Marriott Juhu continues to amaze me in terms of service. Out of all the hotels I normally stay in India, this is the one where staff always address me by name. That is not to say that they all know me well. But they take the trouble to find out my name and then remember it. Their breakfast buffet is another masterpiece. I still have an issue with room sizes and the geography of the bathrooms, but the positives first. The club lounge on the 4th floor is great with great service, happy hour and great snacks. The Oriental restaurant is also great. I did not try the India and Italian on this visit, but I remember them as being very good too. BBC continues to be a great lunch or coffee place.  Now the negatives: 1. The mattress on our bed was extremely uncomfortable resulting"
388,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights with our 4 young children. The hotel was close to the airport, had a great pool (a little too much chlorine), great selection of restaurants and great food, and the housekeeping was excellent! A young lady called Shilpa and her assistant Riya, went over and above their duties and the room was always spotless.  Would recommend to any families."
389,We regularly visit the JW Marriott Juhu with our family for a staycation.  This is the perfect place and resort experience for a family weekend Holiday in the city of Mumbai.   The front desk Manager Vikas Arora and his Team Ishant Malik And Gaurav Batra do a great job to make sure all the guests needs are satisfied.   The front Desk Executive Shoaib Kalal does  a great job for a swift check in experience along with Saif and Jidnyasa who are very swift in keeping guests smiling.   The Lotus Cafe has a great team with Check Alok taking care of all minute details and taken extreme good care for individual needs. And the other service team head Satish and his team Ritesh and Srikanth are always on their toes and do a wonderful service to customers and do not make us feel that we
390,"I have stayed and conducted events in almost all 5 stars across Mumbai, this is by far my worst experience. Hotel was full to capacity and the staff had no clue how to handle that, they surely need training in hospitality. We had booked a month back and had specifically requested for sea facing rooms (booking was for premier club category). We got a city facing room with a dingy and dirty view and the worst bit was when we requested for a sea facing one we were lied to and told that no premier club rooms are sea facing (most of them are, they were simply not available as they had not managed rooming properly and didn‚Äôt honour my request shared during booking for which I was given assurance). The service was slow. The lounge food was subpar. The booze had zero potency. Breakfast"
391,"I had an auspicious start with a late arrival into Mumbai and lost luggage. Even though I was tired and probably a little cranky from not having my luggage, the staff at the JW Marriott Juhu went out of their way to welcome me.   Upon arrival, I was greeted by Yasmin, an absolute breath of fresh air after an arduous journey. She understood my predicament and went into high gear to make sure I was as comfortable as possible. She offered to make sure the hotel followed up with the airline to retrieve my luggage as soon as it arrived. She offered to have a list made up of local shops in the event I needed to buy ‚Äúemergency‚Äù clothes. Yasmin was able to restore my faith in humanity that everything would work out fine. And she was right.    The hotel was immaculate and the rest of the"
392,"This is the nicest property in Juhu.  Despite being around for years, it doesn‚Äôt have the appearance and feeling of being aged. I loved the asset quality, high touch service, politeness of the staff and the diversity of food which were all quite flavorful.  Despite the immensity of the hotel, it still operates in perfect order.  The staff are very happy and get to know the guests.  Any issues are resolved immediately.  One gentleman in particular, Alok Verma, is the Executive Sous Chef needs to be highlighted.  He is quite the talent ranging from (i) menu development and innovation, (ii) managing the kitchen (the hotel was sold out yet one couldn‚Äôt even tell), (iii) speed of service, (iv) catering to customers in what was a genuine, individualized way, (v) management of people"
393,"Me and my wife along with our daughter came to visit Mumbai from hyderabad. We had a great experience...One of the best hotel in mumbai...Room size is small as compared to other hotel...food quality was great...I just hope they have some more options for infants in breakfast but love the family by jw idea. Monika from front office was so kind and helpful and she is so friendly with kids. She came to know that our daughter is fond of dogs so she arranged a dog from the security gate for us. That was so sweet of her and gave us so many toys, books, crayons and chocolates. Well this was outstanding...We requested for late checkout that was granted too by her. My daughter is still missing her...I hope this message will be passed to her. Ritesh from lotus cafe was exceptional and"
394,We had a 2 day stay at the hotel. Facilities and staff were fantastic and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Memorable staff were Rama the transfer driver for his insight and descriptions of the city and Alpa on reception who made check in and out very easy both days. I will be recommending JWM to all that visit Mumbai. Thanks.
395,Myself and my family stayed here in March of this year. Where do I start JW Marriot your service was perfect. All staff from security to housekeepers were all so nice. Greeting everytime they see you. But a special mention goes to Shetty Dhiraj you‚Äôre hospitality will always be remembered I‚Äôm am still speechless. I can‚Äôt wait to come to India and stay with you guys again.  See you guys again very soon üôÇ
396,"I was double charged by the Marriott while I stayed in Mumbai JW Marriott Juhu. I have now spent 2 months trying to get my money back, repeatedly contacting via phone calls and emails their Customer Care (very deceitful name for a non caring department), and the Mumbai Marriott directly and noting is getting done. The level of incompetence is staggering!!!! I am withdrawing of this membership and credit card and will favor other brands like Hilton because I cannot take a chance to work so hard for them to fix a mistake they did and resolve the first time around and once in for all the fact that they charged me twice for my stay. I give 1 star because I cannot give it less!!!!"
397,We were there to celebrate our 12 the anniversary . We had an amazing experience. Staff really was very helpful and courteous be it the front desk executive mr Saif or director of rooms mr Vikas Arora or mod mr Deepak Mehta. All the staff had ensure that we have a memorable stay. The room was perfectly decorated with flowers and towel art along with on the house cake and a wine bottle.  We will rate 5 * to the property and 5 * to staff... thanks JW Marriot team for making our stay so amazing.  Thanks
398,"Stayed here for a night.  Few challenges during checking in, and room maintenance but were resolved immediately once informed about that. Nice and peaceful executive lounge and beautiful view of the Arabian Sea from the room. Would like to thank Venkatesh in the Gym for the wonderful work out.  Was not aware of the yoga sessions that are being held, will try that in my next stay."
399,Fantastic 4 nights. Top service never told ‚Äòno‚Äô everything made possible and over and above. ALL staff from security to pool to check-in staff were top quality. The 2 hour full body massage was the best I‚Äôve ever had. Great experience see myself staying anywhere else in Mumbai now.
400,"We had a suite overlooking the famous Juhu beach. Beautiful and very spacious hotel. We mostly ate at the Lotus restaurant. The buffet had Veriety of Indian and western and Asian food. Chef Rohit was very friendly and really looked after us. There was beautiful music played on the piano during dinner. Lot of masala tea which we enjoyed. Only disappointment was when I decided to have a facial and went to the Spa. The lighting was so dim,you could hardly read the brochure and also the man at the counter was very unfriendly which helped me make up my mind. Hope others had a better experience. On a brighter note, Abhishiek,one of the Managers was excellent and very helpful ."
401,"JW Juhu has always been our favorite spot for Mumbai travels. The staff is quite well versed with the protocols for guests. Staff in Lounge and Gym is exceptionally generous and helpful.   Mr. Kunal Vasant and Sahil Taneja @ Executive Lounge Desk are the guys you can reach out for services anytime and we loved them for their tremendous services.   Ezekeil ""Our Favorite Bartender"" has always amazed us with his cocktail preparation skills.  Team in Gym has always been available and kind to help even at odd hours.  Last but not the least, Chef Akash, Chef Rahul and Rony at Lounge Services truly appreciable.  The property is worth visiting and I am very sure you will be spoilt by the services of the lovely team here."
402,"Had a lovely stay... went for my baby moon n they made it memorable .. from complimentary cupcakes with pink n blue frostings to cute teddies n fresh fruit mocktails as I couldn‚Äôt drink.. mezzo mezzo was impressive n so was breakfast buffet spread . Service was impeccable, our request for delayed check out n sea facing room was catered to. Might come back with my baby again surely.."
403,"Breakfast is one of the best I've experienced food wise (world-wide). Extremely large selection with western healthy (steel cut oats, fruit, nuts seeds), western unhealthy (bacon, etc.), and different Indian regional varieties as well (eg traditional Gujarat). Location is close enough to easily visit may nice restaurants, but quite far from the city centre (if that's where you need to be), but right on the beach. Room was good but on the smaller side for Indian 5 star. Staff were helpful too."
404,Lovely staff that bent over backwards for me and great property and nice restaurants.   Everyone made me feel very welcome and made sure that I had everything that I needed.  I will definitely stay here again.  Thank you.
405,Wonderful stay absolutely stunning hotel the staff was very helpful even the club lounge was having extremely good staff the bar guy Anil was to good even the chef Rahul Bali young hardworking guy was to good with his work overall a wonderful experience
406,I visited here today the hotel was situated at very good location I am pleased by their services they have awesome food the very interesting thing was the location of that hotel which is marvelous I recommend you to visit there at least once and try the buffet
407,I have stayed there many times but was very disappointed this time plus hotel needs to be updated.rooms were very dirty bathroom specially.room service was always late.this is a hotel I really loved. Hotel would have to convince me a lot to go back there again.
408,"My family and I had a wonderful visit here. The staff was very accommodating, warm and friendly. Special shout out to the following: Khalas, Avinash, Akshay, Vikram and Sumeet - they went above and beyond to attend to our needs and wants. Thank you again for a wonderful stay."
409,"If you are looking for a soothing stay at the beach you should select another hotel.    That said, the line staff were amazing as is expected at any JWM.  Truely fantastic and the team works very hard to delight their guests.  The check in process was very smooth, bell staff completely attentive even with the volume of people at the entrance on a Friday night.  We dined at the Asian and Italian restaurants and took advantage of breakfast.  Wow, what a great spread and wonderful service.  I am not Indian but found many Indian dishes to satisfy my continued facination with Indian food.  The major negative was the constant noise.  There was a wedding on Friday and the party spilled over to our guest floor throughout the night.  Then next day there was another party near the pool"
410,"Helpful,friendly and polite staff. Amazing food and decor.centrally located.cleaniless was great. The Buffett provided wide range of dishes with on table service.the saffron restaurant serves the best food and chef Sunil made the food to our specifications and use to be amazing. Thanks guys for making our stay so special and stress free."
411,"Good hotel in a good location. Fantastic morning buffet and great restaurants in the hotel. Rooms however are extremely old/need renovations. This hotel get 3 start for the room condition, For the price paid, i would expect high quality rooms. Also, the lobby bar is supposed to shut down @1am, however at 12.15 the staff was claiming the last call was done/no access top the bar. Given its a 5 star hotel, they should be accommodating to have this open till late as business travelers come in later in the evening to wind down. After a conversation they served us drinks and was apologetic. However initial reaction should be that than it being an afterthought."
412,Srushti is very accommodating and helpful.She made ur stay very comfortable and love meeting her Will be back again and all the best Srushti keep smiling u have a great smile dear üòÉ see u soon back again
413,"Excellent service. Alpa, at the check in table was helpful, patient & kind to my group. She was friendly & courteous. Also, at breakfast in Lotus restaurant the staff is very welcoming & smiling. Especially chef O'Neill, he was great! As well as Parag, the great host who seemed to be everywhere! Both of these men were Rock Stars! I thank them for their help & dining suggestions. A great stay."
414,"Hello, Despite being a regular guest at the JW Mariott I felt compelled to write a review at the outstanding service I received during my 2 week stay here.  What stands out to me the most about this hotel is that it really does feel like a home away from home. Nothing is too much and the customer care is second to none.  Special thanks to chef Alok who was my host during the stay; the little thoughtful  touches mean so much; for example one of my favourite breakfast dishes is poha and somehow even though on days it wouldn‚Äôt be on the breakfast menu a small batch of it would appear when I sat down. Same goes throughout the day, as I was travelling on mine the consideration he showed in making sure I was safe and that I had eaten.  In terms of housekeeping; Ganesh was so"
415,"Brilliant service, great ambience, stunning views, great facilities and meals plus breakfast buffets which is absolutely a must try. I highly recommend staying at the Marriott Juhu property. It's an experience. It was meant to be a quick getaway for us since we were unable to travel to Goa or any holiday destination for my wife's birthday but it actually felt as if we are in a beautiful relaxing holiday destination! A mini Goa in itself, this resort has a harmonious combination of spa, family and business resorts. A special mention to the sales team- especially Karan and Madhura..  They took efforts to show me around. I got to see the various conference rooms and I definitely plan to have my company host an event here. It surely would be a delight for the global employees and"
416,What a lovely hotel. The rooms were good. The food was good and the staff were brilliant! The hotel was near a great location and walking distance from juhu beach.... Definitely would stay here again!
417,JW Mariott Juhu has always been very special to us. As my husband and I first met there. We ended up celebrating my birthday there this weekend. Words can‚Äôt do justice to the view of the beach. Which is just surreal and mesmerising. But what adds to the charm is the great hospitality. Harsha and the entire JW mariott team made it so special for me and were very helpful and thoughtful with all the arrangements. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay and we look forward to celebrating many more occasions with you !
418,"Nice hotel, good reception area, nice Italian restaurant in the hotel and nice Asian restaurant. Couple of issues - firstly the room I had was fairly small and not of a usual business room size ( I stay regularly at the Westin Mumbai garden city and the rooms there are far superior in quality and at least double the size, maybe even triple if you get a corner room), secondly when we got back from work into the Italian restaurant, they were trying to rush us as the chef wanted to go home. Food was nice but when you are back from a long day, you want to relax and catch up during your meal, not feel rushed. Other than that, all good. Asian restaurant is fab"
419,"Excellent place,location,food, facilities, rooms,cleanliness and brilliant staffs To mention few Zeenat, Srinivas, Gurwinder and Jordan, are the exemplary outstanding individual in their own fields/areas of work within the hotel. Made us feel at home.cannot thanks enough for the hospitality they render us during our stay. God bless you all"
420,"We had been in India nearly two months and stayed at this hotel for our final four days. This is an excellent hotel but the thousands of pigeons made keeping the pool clean a problem. As well, every time you looked out the window at the beautiful view, you had to overlook all the pigeons and their ""doo doo"" mess. It was gross. I was really looking forward to spending a few hours by the large, beautiful pool but there was a terrible, rotten smell in the area out by the pool. Staff said it was rotting fish. We noticed later in the day that the smell was gone so I guess it depended on what direction the wind was blowing. Any way, it was such a bad smell that we did not stay outside long even though the pool water was lovely. As well, there was a bar area, but you couldn't get a"
421,We really enjoyed staying at this Marriott. The food was good and the property was amazing. They have a nice spa in the resort and the pool was fun too. We found the staff to be extremely helpful and anytime we had a question someone was happy to help.
422,"We stayed for two nights in Feb - part of marriage party. It appeared that coordination between front desk and housekeeping/room allocation was weak. Super senior citizens, 87 and 82 years old respectively were made to wait for more than 30 minutes before the room was allotted at 11 pm!  Also, in the room these is a level difference ( photo attached) that caused me to stumble and fall. Luckily, I did not hurt myself badly. Please take care of this otherwise somebody may get badly injured.  On the positive side, food was lovely!"
423,I have stayed for 1 night at JW JUHU they have given me the best service as well as some complimentary access n upgradation to upper category ... i would like you should meet ABHIJIT at RECEPTION counter for a surprise service ... no doubt other staff is also treating the guest like FAMILY üíñüòç
424,"I stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu from 1st March till 14th this year and felt very much at home.  The stay was made very special by a fabulous staff team. I‚Äôd just like to say a BIG THANK YOU to some of them.   Gunjan Chawla for being my elite host & taking care of my even smallest of needs. Your kindness I‚Äôll never forget. God bless you ü§ó  I‚Äôd also like to mention the names of some of the staff members from different departments who made our stay a very memorable one & have made friends for life‚ò∫Ô∏è  Lotus Cafe Chefs Alok,  Amit, Stanly & Binu (Thank you for the Rotlas) and going that extra mile to prepare excellent Gujarati breakfast for us üôèüèº Suraj (excellent ginger served with a beautiful smile) Other associates including Amit, Akshay, Atharva, Gurvinder, Salman to mention a"
425,"The food yet again, was of exquisite taste but the service was a little slow. But it did help in enjoying the food at the same time so not too much to complaint . The Dal makhani was no less than the Dal from any famous dhaba of Ludhiana or Chandigarh. Saffron restaurant seems to have made a soft corner in my heart."
426,"The Marriott is lovely, huge, and pleasant. I stayed here just one night, my last day in India after a month-long journey and flew out the next morning.   But I'm writing to Sharad Puri to say that there is someone named Mohidra (I believe) who works in the Bombay Bakery who took my stay from ordinary to unforgettable. I went to buy some snacks, realized I forgot my wallet in my room, and as I went to grab it, she discovered that it happened to be my birthday, and when I came back, she had wrapped up a little cake for me with her compliments, to say happy birthday. It was the perfect way to end my visit to India and represented to me the loveliness of all the remarkable Indian people we'd met throughout the entire trip, and the warmth and generosity of the country. So thanks"
427,"After around 5 years since my last trip to Mumbai I stayed here again last week.  It was wonderful to be back, and I couldn‚Äôt believe the guy at the door recognised me instantly, I was ushered in and felt like a film star with everyone greeting me!!  The hotel has kept its warmth and charm and I only wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer.  As always spotlessly clean public areas as are the rooms.  I enjoyed a couple of hours by the pool, felt like I had never left I love it there.  Executive Lounge was great, nice drinks and snacks in the evening with a good vibe. Always worth it to include it.  My only disappointment was that as I slept so well in my comfortable bed that I missed the breakfast in the Lotus Cafe!! I had been looking forward to that as it‚Äôs always a great start to the"
428,"My friend and I had enjoyed previous stays at this hotel and our current stay of four nights was equally enjoyable. We were welcomed as valued guests and staff members displayed genuine warmth throughout our stay. On the whole they were proactive in anticipating our needs, although there were moments when some individuals lost focus during breakfast service in the Lotus restaurant. Service in the Executive Lounge was good. Our room felt comparatively small (for two people) by today‚Äôs new standards, but it was well maintained. The angular design gave a good sea view. The sliding door arrangement for the bathroom was unusual and more suited to a single room occupant. Overall, the hotel offers high standards and my friend and I always feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù there. Long serving members of"
429,Excellent service from Lotus cafe Fb staff specially thanks to Noel Shreekanth Manager very kind Food was awesome Thanks to all Fb and culinary staff excellent food excellent service this is legend property
430,"Great location (30 mn from the airport and in front of the beach) really clean hotel and room, with a beautiful sea view in our case, but what makes it a fantastic place to stay with children is the staff. All the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time.  Special thank you to Raju from the swimming pool who made lunch time a very special moment during our lazy days by the pool and who makes the best chocolate milkshakes in the world according to my children :) My children (7 and 4 years old) also loved the activities in Mezzo‚Äôs kitchen with a Chef where they tried making pizza, decorating cookies and cupcakes. We can t wait to come back!"
431,"It was our first visit to Mumbai in years and we picked out the property based on the reviews online, rest assured, we were not disappointed. Front desk was courteous and the staff treated us like family. Although I do not usually do this, I believe our experience was review worthy. Great trip all in all, if ever paths converge at Mumbai, I will, no doubt, be going back."
432,"My whole experience at JW was very nice and pleasing. This was mainly coz of the friendly staff. Secondly, because of the wide range of restaurants at the hotel offering different cuisines. Not just that but the food & the ambience was more than perfect too. All & all, it was a pleasant stay at JW :)"
433,It was my first visit to India and I was pleased with the service and facility. The staff were helpful and eager to help tourists. The stay was pleasant and the food was awesome! The sunset view on the beach was my favourite!
434,"The reason I'm a regular guest at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu is because of its quality, service and fantastic facilities. Also need to send my congratulations to Ms Amen Anar for her always kind and warm attention to details. She is super good with customers and highly professional. Employees like her makes the Marriott to be above all........thanks and keep up with the great work !!"
435,Absolutely love this hotel - everything about this place is just wow. They have a great lounge overlooking the beach with the best sunset. The happy hours in the lounge is one of the best places with a sunset view. The staff is ever so courteous - the breakfast buffet is the best every morning. The location of the hotel is convenient and close to the beach. Would highly recommend everyone for a nice stay at this hotel.
436,"The JW is the perfect Oasis for the business traveler. It is right on the nice and wide Juhu beach which offers great views from the room in the morning. The rooms, are reasonably large, modern, quiet and very comfortable, I particularly appreciate the superb gardens and pool as well as the very nice, well equipped gym & spa (hammam, sauna, cold and hot pools...).   Breakfast buffet is a feast, incredibly varied and abundant.  All of that is topped by excellent service, even by Mariott's already high standards, with friendly and helpful staff always attentive to your needs.  It is my go to hotel when in Mumbai."
437,Had a brilliant stay! A big thank you to the entire team who puts up such a brilliant show. When in Mumbai must stay at this hotel.  Saffron is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to. When you come from the busy city life the moment you enter the hotel you feel you are at some tranquil place with a wonderful view of water.
438,It‚Äôs a very good property. Rooms are smaller compare to new 5 star in the city. And other Marriott hotels. Good is good. Hospitality is excellent. Staffs a very helpful. It‚Äôs in the heart of the city in the area juhu. The food and breakfast is excellent. Would recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs well maintain hotel. Large lobby. The swimming pool view is amazing direct to juhu beach view.
439,We are Gold elite members and Just visited JW Marriott Juhu celebrating a birthday with 8 friends .. we had 3 premier club rooms and a Royal lotus suite .. the rooms given were sea facing and v comfortable but the sweet spot was the friendly and out of the way service provided by all .. a special mention for Sonali at the executive lounge who went out of her way accommodating my request be it for fresh coconut water or a scoop of mango ice cream much required after eating a spicy meal ! rusher in house keeping made a pair of beautiful swans using towels for the birthday! All in all very good service ! Much recommended hotel. One mention - pls upgrade the audi and range rovers that come for hotel pick and drop .. they are in much need of upgrading !
440,"One of the best hotels I'v stayed. Good location, nice and comfortable rooms.  Excellent service, very friendly and polite staff, specially restaurant's staff! I saw them every morning and night, always hard working, friendly and helpful. Good breakfast and dinner. The only problem for me was the restaurant area which was always crowded and noisy but still very pleasant experience.  And...  I left my book open on the table not to forget which page I was reading, when I came back to my room I found a bookmark next to my book! It was really amazing that they care and notice :)) Unfortunately I was in harry on my check out so couldn't say thanks.  Special thanks from room no 417 (Feb 28-March3) to all friendly and hardworking staff of the hotel :))"
441,"Having prevoulsy stayed at the excellent Taj Palace, JW Marriot had big shoes to fill.  Unfortunately our first night was not nearly as smooth and personal as we would have liked.  My wife and 2 sons were allocated a room which required a mattress but this mattress had not been organised beforehand and we had to waste time and effort getting that sorted.  When the mattress did arrive it was the filthiest mattress I had ever seen in my life. How the porters were not embarrassed to deliver that to our room I do not know.    We complained. Following that the Marriot team sprung into action.  Initially we were given lots of apologies and cakes and wines.  However for the inconvenience of the first night in an inadequate room we were upgraded to another room and all was well and our"
442,"I have stayed here over the years, as always it never let's you down. From the welcome at the front desk, house keeping to the service at their restaurants is all exceptional. The front desk guest associates are always willing to help. The rooms are clean but do need an upgrade. Can't wait to stay there again. Thank you to the entire team at JW Marriott Juhu."
443,"Lovely banquet for meetings   Food is good,  staff is nice.  I tried Jain food here and it was good. They have nicely maintained everything here. Arrangements in the banquet was good.  Toilets are clean. Overall it's 5 star"
444,"We thoroughly enjoyed our weeks stay at the JW Marriott Juhu. The location right on the beach is wonderful whilst being only around 20mins to the airport (Mumbai traffic dependent!)  The pool and restaurants are all amazing - it‚Äôs very cool to wander from the serenity of the pool onto the beach to see the huge crowds of people all chilling out, enjoying the water and also the yummy food stalls (coconuts, snacks, chargrilled corn, masala chat, pav bhaji etc). But what really sets this hotel apart is the excellent service and sincerely warm staff. We made so many new friends at this hotel so I will try to name a few... to start;  Sahil, Rahul, Priyash, Sarajun, Rony, Kunal, Anil, Amit, Parth, Sonal, Alex and Mehvish - thank you all so much for your amazing food and friendly"
445,"i have visited lotus cafe many times ,i like this place very much.the food and the staff of the lotus cafe are very good.a before yesterday i was in lotus cafe with my family where i met the server if i am not worng his name was hozefa he was very helpful and humble person.my wife asked for the watermelon juice for my daughter which was not a part of the buffet.then also the server hozefa bought the fresh watermelon juice for my daughter.it was really appreciated work.thank you brother for this and have a great future ahead"
446,Arrived late on New Year‚Äôs Eve and found we had booked for 2019 instead of 31/12/2018. Despite being so busy the two managers on duty managed to find us a room . Excellent and relaxing 4 days stay. The hotels offers everything and more than you wish for.
447,In December I was at one of my favourite hotels in India. I always love being there whenever I‚Äôm in Mumbai. The ambience and the service in the hotel is impeccable. One hotel I‚Äôll never ever get tired off!
448,"Last week I stayed here for one day on a business trip to Mumbai. Executive Lounge food was delicious especially Panipuri and sandwitches.  A variety of delicious food was available for breakfast, a special mention for Alphonso mango yogurt. Since Hotel was fully booked , this time could not get upgrade. A la crate dinner was commendable .  staff in all section is very professional and helpful.  Special mention for Ms Shrushti at reception for her lovely communication.  A very relaxing place for family and business trips."
449,"Clean , spacious and excellent staff service . The executive lounge is another storyline on an international level. I would like to congratulate Sahil Tameka the restaurant manager for running an excellent opperation with a smile on his face always willing to go one mile further to please his guests and Alok Verma, sous chef which prepared the best fish meal we ever had in India for the last 3 weeks. I am sure that all the above is due to an excellent management of general manager Sharad Puri , running such a smooth and excellent operation. WELL DONE !! CONGATULATONS !!"
450,"I had an absolutely fabulous stay with my family at the JW Marriott Juhu from February 14-22. From the minute we got there and being greeted by Monika  and Ishaan , all our requests and needs were taken care of! The hotel and its staff went out of its way to accommodate us and make the stay extra special for my wife's birthday celebration that week.  The food and the service were great especially in the Lotus Cafe and the Executive lounge that we had access to.  We had a chance to visit and enjoy the spa and Pravin  was especially helpful in meeting our needs - I wish we could have used this more! The overall quality of the rooms and the level of cleanliness in the hotel was excellent - the hotel is in a great location and well looked after - thanks to all the staff that make"
451,It was good time spent at the JW Marriot Lotus Cafe. The service which was served by Mr. Guruvinder was very professional.  I must say he's a very humble and down to earth person in handling his guests. I really appreciate his dedication towards his work.
452,"Prior to this we stayed at the JW Marriott in New Dehli which was amazing, the service was outstanding. As we had one of the top rooms in JW Marriott Juhu with executive lounge access we had some expectations. We stayed for 5 nights but the service was so poor.   On arrival, the reception staff (who claimed to be the manager) was not attentive and gave us the keys to our rooms and said the luggage would be sent up straight away. We had two rooms booked but couldn‚Äôt get into one with the keys provided. Although we called 5 times over 2.5 hours we did not receive our luggage and no one came up to let us into the room. Initially stating that there is a problem with the lock and an engineer will be coming up. It was frustrating as it meant we missed dinner. We went down to reception"
453,"Trip advisor Generic:I really enjoyed my time at your facility.  It made the best of my stay and gave me some great life memories.  Anal and many restaurant staff were super helpful, hospitable and made me feel home away from home."
454,"The hotel was very nice. Some staff was amazing and took great care of us. But some was very rude. The AC in the room was making lots of noise all night. I had to check out at 3a.m, i asked for a baggage weight scale, i had to call 4 times from 12.30 till 2a.m for them to send me a weight scale.  At the concierge, they thought that we don‚Äôt understand hindi. They were saying bad words about us in hindi, even saying that we were ¬´¬†kunjuce¬†¬ª people. Talking in English doesn‚Äôt mean that i don‚Äôt understand hindi.  Online they says a hotel taxi to airport is inr1500, but once there they says it‚Äôs inr4700.  Even during breakfast, i asked for waffles and pancakes, i had to ask them again and again for them to make it. Some people are taken good care of, some were priorities and got"
455,"The hotel is so amazing, the location is great, the staff so friendly and helpful, the food is so unique, you can try the real Indian food there, whether in lounge or the restaurants.  Rooms are so great with ocean and pool view. However, you have to make sure about the check-in and out times, as I was confirmed about my checking out time and received a call to check out 2 hours earlier, it was really inappropriate from such famous and 5 star hotel. That ruined the great stay I had in this hotel."
456,"J W Marriott, Juhu Tara Road is like our second home. All the members of staff are like our extended family. Mr. Puri‚Äôs team is excellent. We have been coming here ever since it opened. Staff from house keeping to the top management are all professional and are the best. Service in all the restaurants is excellent. It is nice to see that the deserving candidates are moving up."
457,"Awesome stay !!! My first review for a hotel. What makes you come back to this property and why it is so sought after Location of the city. Centrally located, delicious food, warm ambiance and inviting. Spoilt for choice, rooms are clean neat and tidy very well maintained brilliant Staff( makes or breaks a hotels reputation) Gaurav Batra Manages Front office  Courteous personified amiable and affable well spoken ( dealt with me soo patiently , I am highly strung and hard to please ) Keep it up shall come back soon thank you all"
458,"I had an amazing stay at JW. I will definitely come back again. The staff was so polite and welcoming especially Sonali and Sairaj. Without their hospitality our stay wouldn‚Äôt have been the same. Sonali would always greet us and have a conversation with us when we entered the hotel. She also gave us a little gift to thank us for our stay there. Sairaj was just as kind as Sonali was. He would open the doors for us and would always have a smile on his face. The service, food, and spa area was exceptional. I will be recommending JW to everyone. Thank you for your time and hopefully we will see you guys again soon."
459,its a really amazing stay at JW Marriott Juhu . after an very busy and hectic day at work got back to hotel and the moment i get back to room the view was amazing simply amazing. special thanks for the staff who manage to provide me the room of sea view room when the hotel was going full thanks to the team for the effort its really made my day. now being to the hotel i tried all there restaurants and in room dining services. cant say which one was the best because all of them was just amazing. I highly recommend all the travellers who are travelling to mumbai do stay in JW Marriott Juhu or you can just give the visit and tried the food as i am always the fan of there food  thank you once again team JW for giving me such a comfortable stay
460,"I have not stayed with JD Marriott before but I was here at Juhu for work for 3 weeks.  It is a beautiful hotel and to be honest everyone was wonderful to me. Sadly I cannot name them all because I cannot recall every name. The staff in the  lobby cafe- the coffee is delicious but the most expensive I have ever had @¬£6.00 (more than the renowned Taj at India Gate) were all very good and accepted any complaint with professionalism.  Savio picked me up from the airport. JD head of guest services, Amen who looked after me from start to finish Sahil manager of the executive restaurant Zakil my room service boy- all were wonderful. I can recommend one hundred per cent this hotel. Thank you JDM"
461,"This is my 5th or 6th stay for business, the second one to which my wife also joined.We were welcomed by Shabaz, who helped the front desk team with our arrival. He went above and beyond to help us with a request we had. At the lounge which we visited twice daily, Suhil took great care of us and offered suggestions on everything. Rony remembered our favorite drinks and Priyesh was also very attentive. The food at the lounge was excellent, I enjoyed my usual dosas in the morning. My wife swears that the sweets and deserts were outstanding. This is now officially one of my favorite hotels anywhere and its the attention to service that makes the difference for me.   We had a deluxe room on the first floor (162), small but very comfortable with a view of the pool."
462,"We stayed here for 3 nights around Valentines Day and was left wanting for more. One of the best places I have stayed in.  To start with, the location is great. It is not too far from the airport (around 30 - 40 minutes drive) and situated right on beautiful Juhu beach.   The check in process was smooth and personal.  The staff were courteous and helpful. We were staying there for our first wedding anniversary and the staff made every effort to make it extra special.  The room itself was good and had a nice view of the pool area overlooking the beach itself. There is direct access to the beach during day time which was handy. The spa and pool facilities were great too.  Finally, although we did not get to try them all, this hotel has three highly rated restaurants and a mini"
463,"Anil looked after us well!   First time relaxing in Mumbai .. the hotel has amazing facilities! Had a very lovely massage and enjoyed their outdoor jacuzzi, pool and beaches x   Birthday 2 days before checking in... team acknowledged this via passport details and gifted me with beautiful flowers, wine and cake by their guest relations team Monika and shaif  :-D!  Shafron managing /head chef is best!  Thank you Anika"
464,The hotel is best in business and standard is quite high. awsome view from the top rooms.The awra of serving peoples are top class and foods are delicious in taste. it was an happiest experience ti visit.
465,"Stayed here for 5 nights after few yrs gap and found to be back on top in all aspects off service. Front desk, bell boys, doorman and their executive lounge staff and service and food is beyond my words can describe. Thanks for excellence in every aspect."
466,Lovely property to stay in if you are looking for a-amazing ambience and at the same luxury. Also I spotted alot of celebrities. Anil kapoor. Warm and welcoming staff. The food is amazing if you tell them to make something in particular..they would do that aswell
467,"Fatigued after a long trip from Seattle to SFO to Mumbai to Delhi, we finally came to this hotel at midnight. The 5 star features are standard. Good food, good ambience, rooms are comfortable but what made the stay special was the staff. From the servers in the Lotus Cafe where we would turn up looking for coffee at odd hours -- Amal, Sanchit, Suraj, Nikhil and the rest to the best massage and facial I have had in a while from Rupesh in the Spa and excellent Front desk help by Shoaib who helped us a lot when our daughter got sick... As I said, when you book a 5 star hotel, you expect 5 star amenities. The hotel delivers for sure on that and the location by the ocean is a big plus but as a fatigued traveler especially, exceptional staff is what creates the difference between an"
468,"Stayed here for  a single night when I came into town to help with a clients global meeting.  Came in the afternoon before - checkin was uneventful though a room on a high floor was unavailable - stayed on the 1st, thankfully they were able to keep me away from the elevators.  Room was basic but nice enough, dusty though and the housekeeping was clearly just going through the motions.  My room faced the central courtyard and the mesh that is placed to keep the birds from creating a mess in the little alcoves looks pretty awful.  Wifi was decent if not particularly quick, gym was clean and fairly empty - pool was awful though with the area around it looking pretty gritty.  Food was probably the worst - thank god for the options to eat our fairly close by - my room service and"
469,"I just like to mention how I appreciate the politeness of the staff. In particular Aditi, one of the Dining Staff who made it possible along with the Chef for me to be able to eat bread that suits my diet and made me enjoy eating Indian Dishes. Bharat, who fix my room daily and made it comfortable for my 10 days stay. Amazing experience. Thank you JW Marriott Juhu"
470,I was at the JW Marriott Juhu for 6 days  beginning of February 2019 and had the most amazing experience during my stay.The staff from the front door to the front desk infact the entire hotel staff were absolutely fantastic and always very helpful and it did not matter how trivial the matter was. This is the most beautiful hotel with fantastic staff. Thank you everyone for such a spectacular holidays and for Making my time in Mumbai such a memorable one ‚òùÔ∏è We also managed to see the film fare awards.wow what a wonderful experience.
471,this is a first time in jw marriott juhu...overall the hotel is fantastic and the staff also i always remeber that one girl deepali from front desk she is very nice receptionist in hotel.she is always remeber me because of her smille and her good approch to the guest ..and when i'm check out my wife wants to meet her but she is not there for the day so and specially thank you for choclate ...we will definitely come to the hotel when we are in india ...thank you giving us good saty deepali and jw marriott
472,"We had the pleasure of staying at the JW Marriott Juhu for 4 nights, oh how i wish we stayed for more nights! From the moment we arrived we were treated nothing less than royalty, every single member of staff welcomed/greeted us with a smile, from the security to the maintenance staff. This is where the JW Marriott really excel and stand out from other 5 star hotels. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world but we have not received service like this before. Our check in was with a lovely lady called Amen and was very smooth, we arrived early at 9am and as our room was not ready she took us to breakfast in the Lotus Cafe, after we had finished our breakfast we were taken to our room. We booked a Ocean Deluxe room which had lovely views of Juhu Beach, you could also"
473,"We had an incredible stay once again in JW Marriott, Juhu. Our tenth consecutive (yearly) stay there ,I reckon!  As a feedback I would like to mention the following:   Front office:  Thanks to  Ishaan and Ruchari who made the Check-out very smooth and were very accommodating to our needs . üëç  Executive Lounge:  The reception desk staff was always very welcoming!  Akshay( recently joined) always did his best to please one and was very friendly indeed.  Housekeeping: Jose did a great job and made nice towel figures!!  Lotus Cafe: The central point of this hotel!  It was a pleasure to meet Chef Alok Verma. He is genuine, warm & very approachable! He was very attentive to our needs.  Satish and Siddhesh were exceptionally friendly,helpful and efficient!  And the same goes for"
474,"Overall the hotel is fantastic, the food is great and the rooms are of high quality. But the poor check out from Snehal has let the entire experience of my stay at this property terribly down.   One of the staff at the front desk assured me that they will be happy to book me an uber taxi through their phone, as I was unable to do so because of my UK number. A few minutes later when I asked about my taxi, I learn from his colleague Snehal at the front desk, that he has left. She carried out my check out process and simply forgot to follow up with me on the taxi request and when I reminded her she said nothing that can be done.Her tone was very cold, unsympathetic and uncaring, This was a total let down. It was not the uber taxi that was an issue here, it was the way she dealt"
475,amazing service. the is very friendly staff. I looked the food as well. manisha at check in was very helpful. we were well looked after at the hotel. and would like to come back again. do visit for the view
476,"A wonderful property in the heart of Juhu, surrounded by Bollywood celebrities. JW Marriott is a celebrity in itself. Excellent rooms, spacious lobby, world class restaurants, well placed pool, opens into the sea. The property lives to the JW name."
477,"J.W.Marriott !! One of the most beautiful 5 star hotel on Juhu Tara road which gives you a breath taking view of Juhu Beach .  From it's extraordinary lobby, swimming pool to the politeness of the staff JW proves it's worth in each segment.  The staff is polite , friendly and always trying to help you spend quality time with your loved ones.  Special thanks to Manager Ritesh , Sagar & Vikram for helping us have a great time."
478,"From check in to check out, the hotel team paid attention to every detail. The hotel is impeccably clean and elegant. The servers and chefs are devoted to making each meal special, explaining ingredients, asking for feedback, and visibly enjoying presenting the various types of cuisine available in their great restaurants.  However, what makes this hotel truly remarkable is the way they treated me when I got sick. Within 30 minutes of calling the concierge, a doctor called me, prescribed medicine, and had it delivered to my room. Within the hour, when I was not entirely well, an affable, well-credentialed, and attentive doctor came to my room, called the pharmacy for additional medications, and had the concierge deliver the meds directly to my room. All within the hour. The"
479,"Dashanzi at the JW Marriott Juhu was an absolutely superlative experience. From the moment we walked in, met Gayatri Suryavanshi, sat at the bar and sipped the signature Asian G&T made by Shim the bartender we knew we were in for an amazing evening. The ambience, music, quality of conversations with Bartender Dhiraj and Shim were way above average! They entertained, informed and crafted the most amazing drinks. The food fully lived up to the award winning reputation Dashanzi has earned over the years. They designed a special menu for Chinese New Year; the scallops and prawn Dimsum coupled with the garlic and chilli sauce was absolutely memorable and worthy of recommendation to anyone visiting this fine restaurant. The chicken stir fried rice with a Sanpei Claypot Chicken was ..."
480,Phoebe was an absolute fantastic.  She worked hard to be sure we received the room we wanted and was always asking us how our stay was.  Because of her and all the staff we will be returning next month for 8 nights.  I would highly recommend this hotel and ask for Phoebe. In the spa the massage I had was one of the best I have ever had and it was done by Rebecca.
481,"I have been wanting to write this review for a while and bad on me that I've taken so long.  But as we generally jump to write a bad review when we are upset about something I think it's equally as important to offer praise on a good experience... so here we go;  I have stayed at this location many times, and I understand why I keep coming back.  The consistency in good service for one. I can count on things being perfect each and every time.  I have previously spent 29 years in the travel and tourism industry so I feel my expectations are pretty high and I'm generally hard to please.  On the other hand, effort does not go unnoticed!!  Rooms:  The rooms are updated spacious and always impeccably clean.  The bathrooms are beautiful (I even came back to Toronto and remodelled my"
482,"Very good service  . Especially Mr Rahul Mishra hospitality.    His service and personal attention to our guest was really well appreciated   The food variety was awesome. Special mention for pasta, kids enjoyed it a lot. Akshay was good server both of them helps us a lot thank u so much"
483,"My wife and I stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu for 1 week at the end of January 2019.  Whilst I had been to India before on business, this was our first leisure trip to the country.  The room we were allocated was large with a separate walk-in wardrobe and a large bathroom with bathtub and separate walk-in shower.   We had asked for and were provided with, a room with a view to the ocean.  Our room on the first floor, had a good view over the garden and pool area towards the ocean - higher floors we suspect would have had even better views.  The hotel cleaning staff were all very pleasant and left our room immaculate each day.   As a Platinum Elite rewards member, we had access to the executive lounge on the fourth floor.   That was a great facility and allowed us to call in at"
484,Amazing stay here. The services and ambience of this hotel is second to none.  The rooms and corridors were very well decorated and the ease of check in/out was easy and quick. The staff in the breakfast restaurant were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough fir you. Very professional as was the chef.   So want to go back.  Jw you really spoilt me!
485,"I stayed at the Marriott for a night during one of our company events and must say that this has been a very nice experience. Right from the time of check in to the time the event occurred in Saffron to the time I checked out, everyone greeted and asked for my well being. Just very happy and plan to return to stay in Marriott on my next visit to Mumbai."
486,Our visit to the property with friends was an awesome experience. Overall visit to this luxurious hotel was amazing. The most delightful staff with prompt smiling service and lovely food with splendid ambiance what else one need.   After a long gap this was our 3rd visit and the glory continues. I wish good luck to the entire team.   Imp Note : Walking Distance to Juhu Beach
487,"Lovely stay at this lovely hotel stayed over 2 different occasions , lovely rooms , great choice of  Breakfast, very helpful staff at all times , would like  To thank the manager Mr Shabaz Khan for being  Very helpful as my wife fell ill one evening was  Very kind and attentive  Thank you to all at JW Marriott"
488,You cannot beat the staff at this hotel.  Everyone is friendly and they truly deliver white glove service.  The rooms are small and the bathrooms are showing signs of age and need updating.  Security is very strong.  Good amenities.
489,"On 18th of Jan 2018 we went to this place with our friends for a night out.  In evening we visited Club lounge for snacks and high tea. Melky ensured we all had a good time there. He was sharp enough to figure out our likings and stuff we were looking for. One thing he said which stuck me.  Feel this place as your home. Don't feel shy simply order.  It tells a lot about the person. He was very clear about, what is expected out from staff treating guests at Club Lounge.   Around 2:30 am, we all decided to go to Lotus Cafe to see if we can have something before sleep. More than the food, it was the way Anish, Kostubh and Eldrich took care of us is what we still remember.   we all had great fun out there and soon plan a visit to this place again.  Keep the spirit going"
490,"Situated right at the beachfront, JWM Juhu enables a morning walk by the sea.  Appreciating the courtesy of all the staff. The people at the executive lounge on 4th floor are very helpful. Specially need to mention Binu Mathews of the Lotus cafe"
491,"JW Marriot is an excellent hotel, located in Juhu, in front of the famous beach. The staff is very friendly, the rooms, really good and the breakfast buffet, excellent. It's a luxury hotel and you get what you pay for."
492,"A good place to visit. Located near the beach. You find most of the celebrities there. Reflection bar is very nice. Received good service by Mr Pradip. Lotus cafe is little cozy, but the food is amazing."
493,"We were in India for 3 weeks and spent the last 5 nights at the JW Juhu.  The property is located right of Juhu beach and has direct access.  We were able to visit the beach a few times and the convenient location made it easy - the roasted corn is well worth the visit to Juhu beach.  Regarding the property, one employee in particular made our stay memorable.  We had access to the Executive Lounge and Kunal J. was amazing.  He was very attentive with all of the guests and made our stay special.    We had the opportunity to stay in the ocean view facing suite and it is truly is amazing!  Had a great stay here.  We were in an ocean view room for 3 nights and in a suite for 2.    The regular ocean view room is a bit small and dated.    The Lotus Cafe breakfast is extensive and most"
494,"I love Marriott chains - nice, honest, respectable. This hotel is one of the Marriott best - exquisite, clean, good food, good service, good location next to the Arabian Sea Juhu beach. The hotel offers excellent business facilities (conference rooms), good WiFi connection, nice Spa and swimming pool. The issue to consider: it is more than one hour drive to the downtown"
495,"JW Marriott‚Äôs are known as an upscale product in the Marriott hotel conglomerate. I‚Äôve stayed at this particular one a couple dozen times and I can say that I‚Äôve never had a stay without problems. I am a Marriott Platinum customer and have stated in many reviews that this particular hotel is remiss in recognition of this status, as compared to every other JW Marriott that I stay at. This stay I had to ASK for the recognition perks afforded to this status. This is NOT the first time that has happened. Every time I stay at this hotel, I put the ‚Äòservice room‚Äô light on, and yet they NEVER service my room unless I call housekeeping personally. On this stay I left the light on from 8am till 3pm and returned to a dirty room! Really? 6 1/2 hours and you can‚Äôt straighten a room? My"
496,"I first visited JW Juhu back in 2003. Back then it was the best hotel in Mumbai. These days the competition has caught up.  The staff are the highlight of this hotel. They are extremely helpful and friendly.  We found a couple of small issues in the room but nothing which truely spoiled the stay...  Maintenance obviously couldn't be bothered properly fixing the adjustable shower handle so they just jammed a sharp screw in there and hoped for the best. The 'Black-out' curtains were 18"" too narrow so sleeping during the day after a nightshift wasn't fun.  The food is excellent but the room service menu is very limited in comparison to the competition.  If you're not so fit then you should inform the reservations department that you'd like a room near the elevator as some of the"
497,"We travel the world often and only stay at Starwood/ Marriott hotels! We have a extremely high expectation. JW Marriott Juhu exceed that expectation for us. The roomservice and customer service is AMAZING. The cleanliness was phenomenal! We noticed they even clean the light bulbs daily in the lobby!!! JW‚Äôs team members are extremely friendly, professional, and resourceful. The leadership team cares about your happiness. If you‚Äôre not satisfy and/ or have concerns about anything, they‚Äôll encourage you to be vocal. If you choose to be vocal about your concerns and satisfaction they act quickly to find a resolution. Mr. Puri (the GM), Ms. Jidnyasa, and leadership team main concerns for all guests are safety, phenomenal customer service, and cleanliness... you will experience all"
498,Whilst this may have been a jewel in the Marriott crown it now lacks lustre and might easily be taken for being a fake jewel. The location might be convenient if you have to in Juhu area but as for the rest it a hotel that is run down and in need of an overhaul. I booked this hotel online and what do you know - one image of the view only (a deceptive one as you first have to look past the thousands of pigeons and pigeon poop outside one's window and then on to the tired pool area). The room was grimy and dirty and I had to call in housekeeping. Despite sending emails to them saying that I was prepared to pay extra for an early check in - as I was traveling with my 80 year old mum - this was not acknowledged. Whilst the staff were incredibly polite and tried their best it just
499,"JW Marriot, Juhu is the best place for the leisure guests or for those who long for Class Hospitality.  The hotel is magnificient and entrance is very majestic.  The moment you enter in , you experience a lovely fragrance that elevates your mood.  The staff gives you a nice warm welcome.  The place is well maintained and ultra clean, washrooms that are spic and span.  Everything about this place is so Fabulous .  The staff treats you very well.  The buffet at Caf√© Lotus is a must have if you reside at Marriot.  Manager Ritesh and Manager Siddesh was a great host and enriched our dining experience.  The hospitality and the way staff treats you is to be appreciated.  Overall we had a great time and highly recommend !!"
500,"For me most appealing part of my stay was with customer service. Especially special kudos to Head of Spa - Gunjan Chawla. Just amazing, awesome and incredible. Front Desk Manager - Shuchi Sinha who did everything to ensure that my kid was able to adjust food and have a great time with access to kids care. Shard Puri - GM of hotel has gone long way on putting one of the most incredible staff. Hope they can property also elevated like Ritz. But we couldn't have asked to be better place than here. Strongly recommend."
501,"Thank you for all the excellent service always at JW Marriott Juhu , perfect location with easy access to public transport, excellent food , and just on the beach .A 5star establishment with 7star service  A special thanks to Amen Anar , great hospitality .  Regards Shabeer"
502,"The hotel is built so fine and so beautiful that it's just take your eyes and make you think about it. The food was delicious and healthy,staff was very professional and service was excellent and it was 5* feeling to me for staying in this hotel.  Highly recommended Thanks."
503,"We had dinner at Lotus Restaurant, It has great combination of food in buffet, Ambiance is awesome, staff is kind and very cooperative.  It was a pleasure being here, the quality of food gives full justice to the tradition and modernisation."
504,"Pool area used to be very calming and relaxing but it‚Äôs been extremely annotating with thousands of pigeons not only drinking water, pooping and making noses but flying over you and dropping water while you trying to relax. This is BIG negative. Also there are few cats passing underneath your chairs that freaks me out. Around pool is so dirty with pigeons poop. I won‚Äôt visit this hotel again."
505,"Looking for hotel near airport, save and with high quality service? Nice pool outside and good spa area.  Broad viriaty on breakfast and food. Rooms are clean, large and luxurious.  Personnel is always looking after you."
506,"I started falling in love with this Property while it was being constructed in 2000-2002 and was among its first guests when it opened up in Juhu Beach. Since then my family and I have visited it 40+ times on Business/Pleasure, have recommended it to countless others and when in Mumbai is the ONLY JW Flagship we ever stay in. We have stayed in all seasons and Holidays including New Years and were among only a few guests with tragedy struck Mumbai several years ago and this Property remains then and even today one of the safest Hotels to stay in India.  We visited in early January and like other stays reached out to GM Puri to ensure our request for the type of room would be available. I am always impressed when I GM takes the time to personally respond to a guest, (regardless of"
507,"During our trip to India we stayed in 4 hotels, and JW Juhu Mumbai was extremely uneven, and somewhat frustrating.  I would rank them:  Le Meridien New Delhi (9),  JW Bengalore (10),  JW Juhu Mumbai (6), and  ITC Mumbai Grand Central (10).      JW Juhu is not an average hotel:  the look is 10/10 -- it is a beautiful hotel,  functionality is 6/10,  service is 4/10 -- service is so bad that even for thick-skinned guests is likely to spoil the visit.  On the positive side: + wonderful outside pool area, in a cross shape with longer length being 45 meters (great for swimming, even though water is very cold) + modern looking rooms (light wood, glass) + super good quality of food, both in the breakfast area and in the executive lounge + amazing fitness classes by Anita, who is"
508,"This really is an amazing place to go with your friends, family or your partner. There, reflection bar is very nice. Thanks to Mr Pradeep for such great service and looking forward to visit again sometime soon."
509,"The pool was beautiful but the room we were given (as Platinum Elite with Ambassador benefits) was tiny, with little storage or counter space.  Most disappointingly was the service:  During our 5-night stay there, both the Executive Lounge and the Lotus Cafe were perpetually running out of plates, bowls, utensils, food, drinks, etc.  There seemed to be continuous chaos in these places.  However, there are a few staff members deserving recognition: a.  Kunal Vasant Jadhav in the Executive Lounge:  Who was always attentive and active in predicting our needs.  I didn't fully appreciate his service until I saw the contrast on the days that he was off, when his replacement spent most of her time on her cell phone at the desk, despite the chaos due to the lack of service in the"
510,"We stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu from Christmas Eve 2018 till 14th January. I‚Äôd just like to mention the names of some of the staff members from different departments who made our stay a very memorable one & have made friends for life‚ò∫Ô∏è  Lotus Cafe Chefs Binu & Tanmesh (Thank you for the Rotlas) and going that extra mile to prepare excellent Gujarati breakfast for us üôèüèº  And of the waiting staff at Lotus: Anil (whom we remembered from our previous year trip) Suraj (excellent ginger served with a beautiful smile) Aman (yummy fresh carrot ü•ï juice) Krutika (trainee on placement) for her lovely smile & service  Umair (trainee on placement) excellent continental breakfast betaüëç Managers: Ritesh, Sachin, Satish, Siddesh and Shrikant.

511,"From the start of our holiday to the very end, our experience at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu was fantastic. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming and will endeavour to make your stay as wonderful as possible. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in absolute luxury in Mumbai as it is of the highest class. The breakfast cafe is outstanding with 300+ varieties, guaranteeing to satisfy any need/craving. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I would like give a special mention to Dipika and Hussain for going out of their way to make us feel extremely special. I will certainly be returning as soon as possible!"
512,My friends had recommended the Marriot and I am so glad I stayed there. The room was lovely with the ocean view. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was the best I have experienced. The location was close to all the places I wanted to shop at. I would highly recommend this hotel. I know I would stay there again.
513,"I have been to JW Marriot while i was on a official visit. It was indeed great experience staying in one of the best locations in Mumbai. On my request, the hotel staff provided me early check in as early as 4 am in the morning ! It was such a nice gesture ! The food was great but there are limited drinks options in hotel ."
514,Great end to our trip in India! The hotel was very busy but definitely worth it. Great room with an amazing view of the beach and the sunsets!  Don‚Äôt bother yourself to go to Reflections bar because the staff will not even bother themselves to give the drinks menu and will not even ask the guest if they want to order.
515,"Considering factors like location, facilities, food, rooms, pool, gym, breakfast etc etc it is one of the best option that you have. Though a bit costly but considering the fact that it is on the beach it is worth it."
516,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the JW Marriott Juhu. The service and hospitality was above and beyond what we could have expected. From Monika at Guest Services to Akshay and Leon at the Lotus Restaurant, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. One of my favorite hotels in the world by far."
517,"I am a frequent guest at the JW Juhu and this hotel is by far one of my favourite JWMarriotts The lobby is gorgeous and each visit there is a fabulous arrangement i look forward too, rooms are very comfortable, pool is magnificent and my all time favourite is to watch the sun go down in the early evening from the concierge club room...where the food is always delish!!"
518,"Great hotel.  Been staying here every time we visit for over ten years.  the staff are incredible from the moment you step out the car, the staff meet with you with the greatest of courtesy and gently usher you into the lobby and the experience just continues to get better. Reception staff despite however busy it is, seem to have all the time in the world for you and its as if you are that special guest they have been waiting for.  The rooms are very well appointed.  Everyone plays a part in making sure you feel at home and not just another room number.  The food is excellent and the chefs go out of their way to help you choose or to create something special whenever needed.  The waiters are ever attentive, polite and super responsiveness no matter how busy the restaurant."
519,"We stayed at J W Marriott Juhu from January 11 to January 13, 2019.  Recently it appears that almost ninety percent of the older staff has been replaced with younger and more dynamic staff albeit with little experience in service expected of J W Marriott.  This is most likely a transition phase with service in future to reach its pinnacle.  During our stay, there were certainly bright spots in delivery of the overall service.  There were, however, some shortcomings too.  Firstly, we received an excellent service received from the hotel‚Äôs Guest Relations Manager, Jidnyasa, who has always been the hotel‚Äôs ambassador for building goodwill with the customers, relaying with the guests in a manner which is extremely pleasing and most importantly with a knack of resolving service"
520,We stayed here during Christmas week (2018). We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and all the amenities it offered. Special mention to the entire staff of the hotel. They made our stay memorable. Food/Service in Lotus Cafe and Saffron was exceptional.The Club Lounge had great views of Juhu Beach & Arabian Sea with an excellent staff and selection of foods and beverages.
521,"My stay at jw worst this time disappointing.let start first check in ,being a non smoker got the room on the smoking floor as no king size bed was available on non smoking floors .then secondly being a star studded hotel they were unable to provide a hard pillow as it was not available with them for all 3 nights.the cordless phones don‚Äôt charge you need to stand and go to table to talk on speakerphone .the lathargic housekeeping n staff ,it takes an hour and three reminders on phone for a times of India newspaper .moreover you call them at 9:30 pm for a tea the IRD people will say it will take 45 minutes as dinner time is going on ,they take the guests for granted something I dislike completely,no one listens to guests they are just busy flaunting the name ,the service factor"
522,"This is a lovely hotel located on the expansive JuHu beach in the heart of Mumbai.  This location was chosen for our two nights before our cruise because it is located within 30 minutes of the airport. The area is not conducive for walking around , not due to safety, but rather few restaurants or shopping within walking distance.  Here are all the positives  1.  The rooms are beautiful with comfortable beds , well appointed amenities in the large bathroom  2. Staff is attentive and friendly  3. Breakfast included with choice of American and Indian dishes.  Enormous selection of delicious food  4. Marriott members can use the executive lounge from 6:00am to 1:00 am. Serving lunch , dinner , breakfast and alcohol that is complimentary 5. Beautiful large pool with lounge chairs  6"
523,Stayed here for the weekend. Had a great time with friends. Nachiket is very attentive and hospitable. The rooms are lavish. The services are generally very prompt. We would like to visit again soon..
524,"I myself will definitely hire somebody like Hashmeet. Anything I needed he would help me find it. Such a classy man , nice smile , very polite . I will definitely come back this hotel because of him. Thank you"
525,"My Husband and I stayed at this lovely Hotel for 6 nights to celebrate the new year. The room was well equipped with everything you could need with Sea view.  Very comfortable bed and housekeeping did an excellent job, we also found that despite the hotel being on a very busy main road that it was very quite at night, did not hear any traffic noise. The Hotel backs onto the Juhu Beach and guests can go through the swimming pool area where they have to sign out as part security to exit the hotel if they wish to go out onto the beach. We had a small Issue after checking in, we were told to wait while they got our room ready as we had requested a non smoking room, we sat in the Foyer for hour and half, my husband spoke to someone at the check in desk, they didn't know anything and"
526,"Last time I stayed in this hotel was 2015, amazingly some of the staffs remembered me from my last stay. The hospitality and the service is fabulous. From concierge to housekeeping to Lotus caf√© and Deli, people are just great. Especially staffs like Sachchin from the concierge, Sachchin from the Deli and Abdul from concierge. They make sure that you‚Äôre happy and satisfied as a guest of the hotel and provide amazing hospitality. Keep up the great job people like you make travelers far away from home feel at home."
527,"Youre treated like royalty from the moment you enter the hotel. Lots of lovely little gestures make the welcome really special. The team at the hotel are super friendly and go out their way to help you. I have been visiting the hotel for years on at least an annual basis, this last visit really brought home how genuinely service orientated everyone who works here is. The executive lounge is superb, great drinks and snacks. I was invited to take a seat pand was brought a refreshing drink and selection of snacks. The executive chef personally came out to ask if I had any requests. The lounge team were great from the welcome to making arrangements for dinner. I was delighted to taste the shredded lamb cooked by the head chef in Saffron. I was served like royalty by the team in"
528,"Stayed twice in December, at the beginning and end of our India trip. The first room was large, bright and airy. The second was smaller but still comfortable.  Executive lounge was good, good range of food and drink available. I particularly liked that they have a chef cooking fresh food for breakfast - nice touch. Staff in lounge were very friendly, especially Alex.  We ate in lotus cafe a few times for lunch. Service here was great. Buffet was extensive and had huge choice of food to choose from. Big thanks to Sanchit in Lotus Cafe who was really attentive and looked after us. He even gave us a card when we left which was so nice. I had a massage in the hotel Spa which was nice if a little pricey.  I also had a foot massage around the pool which was fantastic and a bargain"
529,"Beautiful hotel and location. Staff is very friendly and knows how to welcome a guest. Breakfast is good en there is enough choice. Rooms are modern, nice and clean. Would recommend this to everyone.."
530,One of my favourites in Mumbai - always try and come for the buffet (lunch/dinner) which is normally exceptional! The ambience of the hotel and the grand foyer are brilliant too. Have never actually stayed here but should try that soon.
531,"Had an awesome experience at Dashanzi !  GITESH in the service team was WONDERFUL and so attentive and warm ! He is an asset to the Marriott team. Gayatri was also fabulous ! Chef Chandan makes the best dimsums ! the prawn, shitake & caviar dimsums are to die for ! Cannot wait to return again !!"
532,"Had a very great start overall check-in was done smoothly by Arti but checkout experience was not so great, loved the restaurant and the food room are not spacious as compared to other JWs but they do offer great view if you got the beach view , lounge is great for having breakfast and evening cocktails with beach view"
533,"I booked a premium room thinking it will be a bigger and newer room. The hotel lobby is amazing but when you get into the lifts to go to the rooms the lifts has panels broken. I was on the executive floor and the corridor walls where dirty, rugged and dirty carpet with a bad smell. When I got into the room, I had never seen a floor with so many holes, the wear and tear on the cupboards, wardrobe all the wood in the room was very bad. Leather cushion where dirty, damp smell in the room. My room got changed but the wear and tear in the room was still the same and room had a very bad damp smell. The lobby and Lotus restaurant looks amazing, 1st night we experienced hair in the food. Next day morning went for breakfast and there was about 30mins wait. And it was very very busy and"
534,"Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel during our family vacation. Aside from last check in, the hotel facilities were amazing, Enjoyed breakfast, the luxurious feel of the hotel, and the authentic ambiance of the environment, traditional and hospitable and great service. Special thanks to Zeenat Bangi for making us feel welcomed both at the start and end of our journey, friendly smile and great care in ensuring we were ok. Also, to the service staff for breakfast, your dedication and quality of service is second to none in all my travels, thank you! Shout out goes to Radhika and Nikhil for always going the extra mile for making my family feel comfortable."
535,"Very clean and maintained rooms..staff was courteous,decent breakfast spread..overall had a relaxing stay..definitely will visit other properties of JW.Security at hotel at power with the standard of hotel"
536,Second time stay at this property and what can I say but Outstanding customer service! Staff went out of their way to make us and the kids comfortable! Executive rooms were very clean. Housekeeping staff were superb!
537,Kunal (executive lounge manager) has a first class personality! The entire staff at the resort was fantastic. They Provided me with amazing accommodation during my stay and I will be sure to return in the future !
538,We were upbeat on our visit to the JW Marriott where we went to stay overnight. Our ordeal started with the check in we were made to wait endlessly till 3:45 pm for room to check in. And we had arrived there at 2:15 on thinking they might be considerate and give us an early check in but we were so wrong!!  We checked into the suite which was beautiful which made us happy and we were pacified as we went to the room. But then we were in for some more sorrow as they made us wait endlessly to send the bags to our room then eventually we had to go ourselves  downstairs and got them up. Pathetic! For a 5 star hotel!    We had a buffet dining voucher which was valid from Monday to Friday we had arrived on a Saturday and we requested them to let us use that voucher since we were
539,Right from the checkin to the staff at the restraint everyone was very helpful and prompt. Tanmesh the chef went out of the way to arrange for sugar free deserts for us and Shruti at the reception was kind enough to spend time getting us a sea view room. The only reason to not give it 5 stars was the poor sound proofing in the room which meant the noise from the corridor of people returning to their rooms at 2am in the morning woke you up and hence the quality of sleep was poor.
540,"I have been staying at this hotel for over 15 years.My wife and I stayed there twice between December 24th and January 3rd,each time booking a suite. Both times,the check in process was cumbersome(the second time,our suite wasn't even ready till 6 pm).   With a couple of exceptions,the staff at breakfast and dinner did not seem well trained. The worst is the male staff in the executive lounge which is totally indifferent. Thankfully,the housekeeping staff remains efficient and friendly.We continue to stay at this property mainly because we love walking on the beach and there is no other hotel offering the JW type of amenities in this neighborhood,which is unfortunate."
541,I stay at JW once a month for an extended time and the staff makes it a great experience and goes out of their way to make its guests welcome. If you need anything they come througb for you with a smile on their face. Thank you for making my visits a great experience
542,I regularly visit the JW Marriott Juhu for business meets. It has one of the best lobbies in Mumbai. Facing the sea is definitely an advantage. Overall dining / buffet/ teatime is good with the service also being good. Will definitely make this an ideal spot for business meets.
543,"My family stayed here in Dec 2018 and for the most part we loved it!  Excellent facilities, breakfast was great, room was well appointed and it's the perfect location.  I do have a couple of comments that I wish to share in hopes the hotel considers improving these: (a) my family and I are quite generous with the tipping so it's rather annoying to have both the floor and entrance staff constantly soliciting tips when we've either already tipped or didn't think it appropriate to do so.  I refuse to believe this is how it is in India because I travel to other Indian cities and stay at 5-stay properties there too and it's not like this everywhere. (b) At the time of check out the billing was not ready in spite of my request and took far too long to sort out using up all my buffer"
544,"My family and I recently had an excellent stay at this location. We had initially stayed at another hotel, but decided to change our reservation based on issues with that hotel. When we called the JW, the general manager, Sharad Puri, was very quick to accommodate us. We needed interconnecting room for the duration of our stay and Mr Puri made it happen. The property is beautiful and well maintained. The service is impeccable and very responsive. One of the highlights is the breakfast buffet at the Cafe and the highly attentive staff. In particular, I want to recognize Anjali and Taufeek in the Cafe. They went above and beyond in taking care of us during our stay. I strongly recommend this property."
545,I do some of my business meetings at lotus cafe. visited this place with my vegetarian colleague and he was very happy with options he saw on the menu. He liked the service and warm open ambiance of the Cafe.
546,"The first day I entered the weight gym I was greeted by vyankateshrudra, a fitness trainer. He came alongside me to support my workout. I had not been to a fitness trainer in years.   He allowed me to understand what I could do to reach my fitness goals in a clear and concise manner. Keep in mind that I had not hired him to help me, he just volunteered.   He not only gave me a fitness plan in the course of a couple of workouts, but he demonstrated the workout. This motivated me to work out every day and sometimes twice.   vyankateshrudra is one of the highlights of my trip to India and this was my first visit. He knows his business of fitness well and I encourage you to seek him out if you visit the gym. Tell him Bob sent you!"
547,"All the outlets at JW Marriott Juhu are truely amazing. Lotus cafe has been an icon for a long time and it has maintained its class for so many years now. Also the other speciality outets are truely of international standards with excellent F&B, ambience and top notch service."
548,"Great place! Great service!    Had been to JW for a buisness Devlopment meeting, have done a good job maintaining the property also these guys were very humble in helping me out.  Thanx a lot guys keep up the great work"
549,Good hotel lively good selection of all foods from around the world good location for the area will see all Bollywood stars very lively parties also has great rooms for individual parties functions conferences
550,Highly appreciate the kindness and hospitality extended by the F&B service team of JW Marriotts mumbai Team.   Lotus cafe Christmas brunch just made me and my family happy !! Despite of the huge crowd the attention and utmost care taken for our table was overwhelming !! Cheers !!
551,"Went for a Sunday brunch, had a ball of my life ! You can‚Äôt ask for a  better experience on a Sunday than the lotus cafe at Marriott, juhu. God bless this beautiful property , amazing chefs and rocking F&B guys ! Cheers!"
552,"We stayed at the hotel during our 4-day visit for a friend‚Äôs wedding December 17-20. The hotel facility was lovely and the breakfast buffet was phenomenal. There were so many options and the waiter - Sumeet - introduced us to several traditional Indian foods to try. We came back to sit at his table every morning and he had our preferred beverages on the table waiting for us. Even the manager greeted us there each morning.   I took advantage of a 90 min deep tissue massage at the spa which was  wonderful. Afterward, I relaxed in the jacuzzi and sauna. I also got a pedicure at the salon. They didn‚Äôt have a typical pedicure chair, but the nail tech was great.    My husband came down with a cold while we were there and the concierge called out for some medicine and delivered it to"
553,"This is absolutely the worst place to go to unprofessional staff, they dont inform you about any type of licencies and any type of information that you need to do, food was below average according to price you pay price was above service expected and above all ruse staff and unpolite managers that point to you when they speak to you on a very rude manner. Would never recomend this place and will always inform friends and family to do their parties in many other hotels in mumbai. Jw is not worth the at all the money you pay."
554,"My first experience with the Juhu Marriott was over a decade ago when a friend had come from US and was staying here with his family. I loved the experience so much that I finally convinced my wife and 2 kids to join me for a short weekend staycation at the Juhu Marriott. What followed was a mediocre stay. And a really poor experience with customer service.  1. Before arrival:  The booking experience on the app was perfect. I booked for only one night and planned to extend it based on the experience. The app also has this wonderful feature to ask for extra service. I usually ask for an extra blanket and did the same here. The response (which came from the hotel, not the group) was in Bold Capitals. I was initially taken aback at the implication that customer service rep was"
555,"We stayed for the Christmas holiday.  The hotel is right on juhu beach and the property is quite large and quiet so you can relax. Even though it's a large hotel  it never felt crowded. The lotus cafe breakfast has something for all diets and they did a wonderful Christmas  brunch with even turkey. It has a lovely pool right on the beach and a good beauty salon. I can't comment on the spa services as I didn't use them, but the beauty salon is good. They also have an excellent executive lounge. The hotel is good for both business travelers and family holidays. The staff is well trained and answered all my sometimes silly questions.I would definitely stay again"
556,"Our hotel stay has been so bad that I'm forced to write a review while staying at the hotel currently. I'm booked to stay here for 7 nights with my hubby and a 2 year old daughter. We are Marriott Platinum Premier elites and have traveled extensively in our lives (60+ countries for me and my hubby and our little one has already been to 24 countries!). We only stay in luxury properties around the world and this is has been the worst hotel of our traveling journey with our daughter. I cannot emphasize enough that don't come here if you have a child. They will try to make your life way harder than it already is.   1. Arrival - When we arrived at the hotel, the outside area was crowded and no one came to help us with our luggage. I had to go find someone who can come can help us"
557,"This is my 3rd stay at this hotel over many years. I have always enjoyed the hotel, services and staff. However this stay was very disappointing. The hotel was extremely busy but unfortunately the management did not seem to staff the hotel to keep up with the number of guests.  Consistently Long lines and long wait times at the front desk, bell stand the executive lounge completely full with no room to sit and staff so limited to keep up with the number of guests, food going so fast it was hard for the staff to replace it so quick and the concierge desk not as friendly as they once were definitely will make me rethink staying here during my next trip. I highly recommend the management provide the staff required to meet the hotel occupancy and number of guests.  I truly also felt"
558,"I was on a business trip to India and wanted a place to take a break from the long flight. It is a great place close to the airport, and all the employees are supper friendly and nice. The rooms are not very new, and I had some issues with a plugged sink. I felt safe and visited the beach multiple times and enjoyed mingling with the locals."
559,This has been a constant good neighbourhood hotel for me since teen years. Been here so many times. The last time we choose it as we had a good online deal and thought of relaxing over the weekend. The stay was good and comforting. The swimming pool as usual was the best part about the hotel. The breakfast was good and live counters were very good. South indian dishes were stand out in particular. The best part is the view of Juhu beach and the lovely sunset each evening. Our purpose was fulfilled and had a very relaxing weekend stay at J W.
560,"JW Marriott is iconic as it was for sometime the only 5-star presence in Juhu. Others were always more of 4-stars in their decor, service and food.  The hotel is an older property but decently maintained. The rooms are functional and updated. The swimming pools are clean and pretty big.   The Juhu beach entrance is well guarded and easy for in-out. The beach gets really busy, being a city beach. But sunsets are worth. Those who love walking on beaches, will enjoy the long and wide beach.   The breakfast spread was big and had a lot of variety. Chef Aniket did a egg benedict for us and was very decent. Coconut water served was a great touch as a beach-side hotel. Rest of the food was more of crowd pleasure.   The Meza Meza offers very refined Italian experience and worth the"
561,"I have currently checked in to JW Marriott Juhu property for my wedding anniversary , the reception made us wait for 1 hour even when we made an online check in and reached an hour later then standard check in time . We asked for water thrice but the staff at reception did not provide us for an entire hour . Finally when we checked in , we got a room having view of construction site with construction workers peeping and lot of noice . I will not recommend this property to anyone . It‚Äôs waste of time and money ."
562,Lovely place I went dinner with my family Food was Awesome specially live counter team is very positive and fb service was excellent specially thanks to Shrikanth he make excellent evening in JW Marriott Juhu lotus cafe
563,This is probably our 12-15th stay in over 13 years with stays of 2-7 nights each time . The guest  service at reception is lacking from it's usual pro-activeness.Rooms and common areas need a slight revamp . Our dinner at Mezzo last night was a disaster as the salad and lasagne was just too salty .the lasange was neither filled well . To top it last night we could not sleep as there was a group that created commotion and through duty manager took 3 hours to resolve it and no apology .
564,"Ambience here was really great. I recommend it especially for late night dining. There was great variety in food, especially sea food, with endless customisations available. The sea food was really tasty and juicy. I most likee the oysters and salmon. Further, location  was excellent, walking distance from Bachchans' Residence, although a closer Juhu beach was filthy. The staff is good and energetic, however, there is still scope for more."
565,"Awesome hotel ! Food was great , the service was impeccable! I left cash in my jacket, when I sent it out to be dry cleaned, and every dollar was returned!! The staff is very honest and efficient!! Very impressed!"
566,"I am a Taj Inner Circle Platinum member and always stay at Taj Hotels. But off late I decided to change my hotel loyalty to Marriott only to be disappointed. I stayed at JW Marriott, Juhu thrice in December. And I have had disappointment almost all the time. Last visit was on 23rd and 24th December night. I had booked a Deluxe Ocean View Room. But the room given on the second floor (room no. 258) was a rooftop view room and ocean view was just partial. When I asked for a better room I was told this is the best. When I put my foot down, my room was changed to a room closer to the ocean but on first floor (room no. 166). Which has a nice garden view but Ocean View is partial. Also the duty manager didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to check if I like the room. A bell boy was sent to shift"
567,My family stayed from 22/12/18 to 24/12/18 in room number 267 and 277. Positive  Rooms are nice and neat and clean. Breakfast and evening snacks are superb. Negative  Room service and restaurants you need to wait 45 minutes to an hour and room service staff don‚Äôt understand your requirements may be not conversant in Hindi or English
568,"No appreciation for Marriott Platinum as for an upgrade, but it is a nice hotel. The people in the different restaurants were very nice. I tried to get some French bread at 11:01 PM and the in house local bakery wouldn't help me. The front desk couldn't help until I discovered that they had a buffet with bread. Seems silly that I had to go steal bread from the buffet."
569,"this is the first time,I stayed in this hotel.as I found the good view and good room online..but it‚Äôs not the same..I booked it ocean view but that was not given.on check in receptionist told me that she will give us the same room we booked for..then later they said it‚Äôs a city view...but when I checked in the room which was given,was smelling so badly and it has a construction site view..I would say 4 star hotel rooms are far better then this..the washroom is so small and it was a worst experience for me..I didn‚Äôt feel that I was staying in a 5 star hotel...so if you book it make sure they confirm you for ocean view or else..I won‚Äôt suggest this hotel.."
570,"The place is a must visit place in Mumbai. The ambience is soothing and pleasant. The property has rooms which are well maintained. Dining area and coffee shop, along with some shopping üõç area. We visited to attend an education fair held in its premises. Its close to the airport . Have a nice visit :)"
571,"Although we have stayed here often this was the first time that my parents also stayed within us. I was very impressed with response I had at the time of the booking as I had requested the rooms as close together as possible & near the lifts , they were very accommodating. My parents enjoyed there stay, were overblown with the breakfast at the Lotus cafe in the morning , very impressed with the service. But were let down in the evening at the same cafe, it looked if the the staff were not interested. We all were looked after well by Deepak Kshirsagar, who made our stay very comfortable as did Ishaan ( rooms division) no request seem difficult for them ( very impressed) We were also introduced to Gunjan Chawla ( Director of Spa ) Who impressed as to the service offered at the"
572,"Hi!  I happen to be a Platinum Elite member for the past 7 to 8 years.  As a loyal guest of Marriot, I use Marriot hotels for my stays. Work takes me to Mumbai every month and I used to stay in Jw Marriot for years . Lately the hotel has lost ground on the personalised service which was given to guest like me which resulted in myself moving to other hotels in the city. However last week, I checked in again after a gap of 6 months and I was amazed with the level of Personlized service.  Ishaan look pain and personal interest to sort my requirements even when the hotel was sold out. He personally moved my room and was on the phone with me at 10.30 pm also. Thank you Ishaan. Front office manger Mahesh managed well and did his best after he cane to know that I had a fall in the"
573,"Hotel has great location near the airport and on the beach. Great for a morning stroll on the beach. The pool and gardens are well maintained and the restaurant has amazing spread and variety of food for all meals. The service is par excellence. Staff is very courteous and professional. We were impressed by Chef Alok Verma, Amen, Kunal and Sumit. The hotel even celebrated our special event."
574,"I'm a Platinum Elite with Ambassador service so my expectations are a bit on the higher end. As such, I'll make it simple and share the good and the not so good.  The good:  1. Central location and on the Beach 2. Property is well kept 3. Breakfast 4. Saffron Indian restaurant 5. Shrikant, Shahikant, Chef Abdul and the Executive Lounge staff.  Not so good:  1. Took almost half hour to check in 2. Took more than half hour to get my luggage down upon check out 3. Charged for pressing that I typically get complimentary at all other JWs as platinum elite. 4. Welcome 1000 points not given 5. No suite upgrade"
575,"I visit the JW often and use the Spa quite a lot.  All the Spa staff are so friendly and accommodating. In particular Livvi, Karuna, Notso rainy and mahesh are a few of the names that pop to mind for providing a wonderful service. POleae keep up the good work for 2019."
576,"First time to stay and this place was not let me down. Just lost the way in this r√≤m very often in each day. My room had very nice view, spent half day to chillaxed at living room to enjoy the view. Thank you for upgrading my room on my past trip."
577,"I did love this Juhu property in Mumbai! The staff was pretty amazing including Gunjan, Elite Host and Director of the Spa! The rooms were clean and modern, the lobby was inviting, spa was relaxing, and the views were beautiful!"
578,This is my go place for a midnight coffee with a sandwich and a tete a tete with good friends  . Great place e for after party hanging out not many places where u can chill and relax.  I would really appreciate  if u could train your staff a little more.   I like this place for it's spaciousnes and again for the convenience.  Easy to get to juhu .
579,"J.W Marriott is one of the bestest Hotel I ever visited, mainly I visited here for Sunday Brunch at Lotus Cafe with my dad and we really had a great time there. It is located on the ground floor and there's a buffet system, in which there were soo so many different kinds of food items were there in Sweets also there were so many different things to eat and also there was 3 singer's who were singing so many English songs very beautifully and then the view of the backside was also visible from their, and it was really very beautiful with a swimming pool as well. Now talking about service at Lotus Cafe so it was also very nice and fast.   Overall had a Amazing Time There."
580,My 5th stay since May 2018 . It was 2 all..as in 2 stays pleasant...2 full of glitches and lack of professionalism.But I need to stay here for it s location.  What can I say...All I ask for is value for my money. And I have stayed in all categories here....room...connected rooms..suite..  5th stay...bad beginning.How can a suite reserved as  a 'smoking' suite not have ash trays. Or a suite booked for 3 adults...paid for in advance not get the extra bed till 9 pm at night. And how can the tea service in the suite be so stingy as to have 2 sachets of Darjeeling...2 sachets of English Breakfast..and no watter bottle.    Mahesh is the Duty Manager and he very politely and professionally accepted the issues I raised and has promised better service and hospitality.  I hope it is given.
581,"Visited with family one Sunday afternoon for a quick brunch. Really liked the ambiance, the vibe, the live music and the food. My kids also enjoyed playing at the toddlers play area post brunch and that kept them busy for quite sometime. The hotel is beautiful. Will visit again. üíï"
582,"Ambience perfect, variety of food for Buffet endless, table well set everything in place. Food tastes amazing and you want to enhance your visit and enjoy the time let Mr. Rahul have a chance to attend and serve you. You'll have one nice experience of how warmly and courteously you can be treated. Very well mannered, respectful towards his guest and prompt service is his speciality. Thank you JW Marriott Juhu for this beautiful Evening."
583,"This hotel does many things that a 5 Star should. The rooms are extremely well appointed, very clean, and the bed is extremely comfortable. Nearly every room has some of a sea view, palm trees, etc, and the lobby area is spacious. There is a very good variety of breakfast food in the very spacious restaurant on the lower lobby floor, and there are many amenities on offer elsewhere. The garden is formulaic, and the swimming pools are pleasant. When one has an extended stay it‚Äôs the little things that start to count, and it is here that the hotel needs to improve. Service was often really excellent, but my trash went unemptied a couple of times, more than once I had to ask again for my egg order at breakfast, often the salt and pepper mills were empty, sometimes the cutlery was"
584,"We stayed at the JW Marriott for 3 days in Mumbai. Overall, the stay was great as expected from this property but what made our experience truly memorable was the outstanding service from the staff. They went above and beyond to meet all our culinary requests and provided a level of service that I have not experienced personally at any other property  The best dinners (yes we went back multiple times) was at Saffron and we received the best service ever from Vinay!!! He got us to have the best seating, prepared special dishes and delightful surprises were thrown in every time he came to the table. It is folks like him who transform a hotel experience to a whole new stratosphere.  We loved the ""musical theme"" where the Santoor was played one night and the musicians were"
585,"We arrived late around 11 pm.  Staff couldn‚Äôt have been better.  As soon as we enter the premises we were greeted with üôèüèº.  Hotel front desk looking very sharp.  Friendly smile.  Check In was a breeze.  Rooms are very clean, spacious.  They tend to your every need.  Gym, sauna, steam room.  Very clean.   Downstairs at the lotus cafe for breakfast..  so much variety of food.  Yummm..  being a foody..  security is also very good.  Want to give shout out:  Front office: Mahesh, kunal, Senegal, Hasmeet, Gaurav (desk manager). Chef: Chris,  Service: Sabby, Kaustubh, Larsen, Priyesh(sorry if I mis pronounce), and few others.   Thank you for all you do.  YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST AND OUTSTANDING.  hope to see you all soon.   LOVE JW MARRIOTT , JUHU."
586,"Marriott always fascinates Perfect location  Right on the beach  5 mins walk to juhu chaupati !  Big spacious hotel, amazing breakfast spread ..................... Courteous staff  Overall great experience   It has to be marriott again on next visit"
587,"This was my first stay at this property, and the staff did their best to be welcoming and helpful. However, they generally seemed less experienced and less well trained than those employed at other hotels I‚Äôve stayed at in Mumbai (notably in the lounge). The stand-out employee was Rahul, who serviced my room each day. He did a great job and was always delightfully cheerful. The reason I can only stretch to a three for this hotel is because my room, which I had upgraded to, was located above the pool and an area where late-night parties were held. Pounding music filled my room on two occasions, going on until after 1am one night. I did complain but the music went on and only platitudinous apologies were offered - certainly no compensation or bonus loyalty points. All-in-all, for"
588,"We stayed there for over a week. I enjoyed each day. The hotel is on the beautiful beach and also has a very nice pool. Very comfortable and clean. Service is very good. The food is excellent. Breakfast and dinner buffet are very good, but Italian restaurant is a hit. We ate there 3 nights in a row and every time we enjoyed. I would gladly come back."
589,Its was really an amazing food prepared in the buffet.  There was so much of variety for food present that we were confused what to eat but we hv to taste everything and the delicious food items which we liked was the chicken briyani. I would recommend everyone to try Sunday brunch in jw marriott juhu
590,"nice rooms overlooking the sea, great place for a hotel to be as juhu area is one of the best area in mumbai, the hotel has a great ambience , excellent food and cuisine, a super pool and overall you want to go again at the hotel the place is so good"
591,"My 2nd time staying at the JW.  Just as great as my first.  We stayed 6 days total.    General hotel:  Great.  Everything is clean, Everyone working is friendly and very helpful.  Security personal are very friendly and always helpful.  Everyone you pass that works at the property says Namaste to you with a smile.  Room/Housekeeping: Excellent.  Room was always tidy, cleaned and left the way we wanted.  At time we did come back from breakfast and the room was not ready, but easily spoke to the staff and everything was back on time for us.  Room was a sufficent size and great.  Though our booking did say we would get a king bed, we ended up with a queen.  Lotus Cafe:  We had breakfast here every morning.  The quality and diversity of the spread was phenomenal.  You literally"
592,if you are in Mumabi and looking for a place to stay near beach than this is the place  you can get amazing view and is locate in location near by market area also. i loved the hospitality and warm gestures of the staff people  I enjoyed the food and stay fully thanks to the hotel
593,"This hotel is amazing. The staff are the jewel in the crown. They make you feel so welcome and are very attentive.I will definitely like to visit in future with the family. Overall service right from the entrance until the exit was superb. Epitome of luxury, world class hotel, that will take your breath away & sweep you back to Indian traditions of unmatched perfection-ed high end luxury hospitality."
594,"Without a doubt JW Marriott Juhu is the best place for all types of visits, the rooms are Excellent and also the food leaves a good taste to your mouth every time. The staff is also very friendly and good"
595,Wonderful food with some great live instrumental music and very courteous and friendly staff esp vinay was a great help in choosing the right stuff and the right quantity very warm and friendly staff. Loved the experience
596,"I stayed here when I was visiting our factory for two days.  The whole experience from the minute you walk into the very grand entrance right through till breakfast, the room, the pool and spa...all 5 star standard.  The breakfast is one of the best I‚Äôve had in any hotel in the world and I travel a lot. One thing JW Marriott is renowned for is their breakfast. It is well worth starting your day here. Mr Alok Verona the me hotels Exec Sous Chef was such a pleasant gentleman and really nothin was too much trouble. He always looked after me whenever he saw me sat on my own at the breakfast table! Perhaps because I stood out as a lonely business traveller!!  The rooms are stunning, the sea view amazing and the whole hotel is sparkling clean as though it was brand new.  I highly"
597,Excellent Rooms with very quick service. Mainly the Buffet Breakfast... More than 50+ dishes.Amazing Experience & most importantly Sea faced Rooms. Amazing view from the rooms.  1 min walk to the Beach
598,"JW Marriot is located at the heart of mumbai, juhu . This place will surely outpass your expectations. Lobby is grand. Property is very well maintained . Staff is very friendly and allways there to help guests. Every nook and corner of this place is very clean . Washrooms are very hygenic. The live band is fantastic. If you are a foodie, you must visit the brunch.Food is very tasty.Manager Shrikanth is a great host. We loved the hotel and highly recommend you to stay here"
599,"The moment you step in, there is a WOW vibe to this place.Everything is so well done up and maintained so well.Courteous staff at the enterance , the hospitality is simply amazing. If you are a foodie then you must stay at this property bcoz the brunch is a must have. Mr Shrikanth will take good care of your taste and will ensure you leave content. Property is simply and mind blowing. Every nook and corner is well done. Very clean hotel !"
600,"Beautiful resort with lovely room, upgraded for honeymoon but on smoking floor which was obviously smelly. Breakfast was amazing as with the dinner.  One evening they were preparing for film festival therefore lots of preparation undergoing so dinner was interrupted by construction staff.  Dashanzi restaurant was brilliant, a must dining place even if you are not staying at the hotel. Room service was brilliant and hospitality of staff was impressive.  Look forward to passing by again."
601,It was my first time with JW Marriott  And it was a wonderful experience over all  Butler service was excellent  All the restaurants and bar have done their best  Evening swim near pool Bar was very relaxing
602,"My 6th stay with JWM Juhu!! Everything is amazing as always, perfect, five stars for everything.  Super polite staff and waiters.  But!! But!! Rooms are still provided with old Bose wave music systems. LOL!! They have old iPhone Jack docking, AUX cable provision which apparently not possible in today's era, we don't carry CDs with us anymore. So we ultimately have to end up listening Radio stations with numerous advertisements. Please upgrade the speakers with Bluetooth connectivity ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
603,"The current service team at JWM is top notch:  special kudos to the following staffers who made our stay exceptional:  Binu Mathew, Rahul Rajan, Siddesh Bharat, Srikant Patro, Shabaz at the front desk.  These guys did all and more to enhance the quality of our stay at JW."
604,Great service and excellent location. Can not fault anything at all. Best customer service from each staff member. Nice and clean room. I will highly recommend to my friends and family. A big THANK YOU to all for looking after us and specially reception team for going extra mile. We truly appreciate :)
605,Ok so I‚Äôm biased towards this particular hotel that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been visiting it since it opened in Mumbai and I‚Äôve never seen the service or upkeep go down. Why you should visit :  1) the best view of the beach across Mumbai. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say no other hotel has such an amazing view.  2) if you like Indian food their Indian restaurant is in my top 10 across the GLOBE. The Italian can surely improve.  3) the staff ! I would have named a few but if I miss out any I would feel really bad but surely you guys are doing an amazing job.   It‚Äôs a no brainer to stay here or dine here.
606,"JW Marriot Juhu is an excellent property. The location is great and the staff and service is top notch at par with international ratings.You will really love it. An extraordinary leader can change the entire direction towards sucess. Mr. Sharad Puri, the GM of this ultimate property is that extraordinary commander. I wish him the very best in his endeavour in the hospitality industry and also my gratitude for taking such good & excellent care of me during my stay there. I want to praise that lady who welcomed us, at the reception, forgetting her name. I am  also thankful to Mr. Batra who gave me an opportunity to stay in this wonderful property. Many thanks."
607,"We stayed at the JW Juhu for 4 days in October. October is the hottest month in Mumbai, so every time we stepped outside the hotel we were basically melting :) a very humid 37 degrees celsius with zero wind! The swimming pool looked amazing and clean but we didn't have the chance to swim in it as we were there for work, but definitely it is worth trying because it looks great and there were just two people there, so very relaxing. The hotel is right on the beach and the the beach access is through a gate that has a heavy bolt, a guardian, and and electric fence, it's like trying to escape a high security compound, or just a preventive measure against zombies attacking from the outside perhaps.  The beach looks great from a distance, however it is horrendously polluted, basically"
608,I stayed at the JW Marriott for a short visit in Mumbai. Excellent overall hospitality. Thank you to the entire team for taking good care. Definitely would recommend this hotel. Rooms facing ocean would be ideal.
609,"JW Marriott has Altogether 2 JW Marriott Properties in Mumbai, One Is Situated At International Mumbai Airport Area, and This One is Situated On Juhu Beach, Juhu Tara Road.  JW Has Got Beautiful Huge Complex, Along With Beautiful Swimming Pool, Garden, Chilling Area with Beach View, Theres a Short Cut To Juhu Beach From the Premises, JW Marriott has also got Few Shopping Centers Like Raymond Showroom and Few Cakes Shops.  JW Marriott has also got All Day 24*7 In-house Restuarants Which Is Lotus Cafe Which Serves Amazing Buffets, Brunch and got lots of Varieties, its Multi-Cuisine Restuarant."
610,"Stayed 3 nights and was excellent base for visiting and exploring Mumbai.  Received very warm welcome on arrival at 1a.m.  Delightful room facing pool and sea located close to Executive lounge.  3 excellent restaurants.  Lotus Caf√© possibly offers the best brunch in city.  Executive lounge well stocked.  Hotel concierges most helpful and knowledgeable.  Swimming pools well maintained and serviced.  All in all and excellent hotel offering good value compared with other 5 star hotels in city,  Bonus is being close to airport."
611,"Loved every minute of our stay...every staff member was fantastic, service was first class. Special thanks to Sumeet and Melky (pictured, the ones with ties!) who went out of their way to make our experience so very special. We will be back!"
612,Excellent place to relax and enjoy with family and friends. Service is very good and all staff members very helpful and approachable.Safe place for women and kids too. Food is delicious and there lots of variety. I enjoyed on my favorite dishes. And also relished on lots of veg and non veg Indian dishes too. Super happy we all enjoyed together
613,"Looking for a perfect Sunday Brunch place? Head towards JW Marriott, Juhu at their Lotus Cafe, which has a colossal brunch spread & I'm sure you won't exit being disappointed!  So, we visited Lotus Cafe by JW Marriott Juhu, for their Sunday brunch.  We were stunned by the hospitality at JW Marriott and were well greeted at every point.  The Sunday brunch costs around 2900+ taxes for a non alcoholic brunch and 4250+ taxes for an alcoholic brunch.  As you walk down towards the cafe, you can get a glance of all the live counters.  To uplift your brunch experience, they have set up a live band performance. Such a delight to hear them while hogging on some good food.  They have the following counters:  Chaat Counter:  You can get all the varieties of chaat like Pani puri, Sev Puri,"
614,"I travelled from Pune and my mum travelled from England during Diwali to see each other after we hadn't seen each other in 4 months! I am going to an international school and we met at JW Marriott hotel and couldn't of asked for nicer, more helpful staff and an amazingly beautiful hotel. The room was lovely and comfortable, with a lot to do around...we would definitely recommend Linking Road for a good market.  There is a lovely pool to relax in, as well as a variety of tasty food for breakfast. There is many nice restaurants around if you do not want to pay for the dinner, but i would definitely recommend the breakfast!"
615,"For me it is home away from home. This hotel provides you a luxurious stay but with its personal touch. Excellent beach facing rooms. I always enjoy the stay , food and hospitality of this hotel.  Do try it out !"
616,"This is one of my favourite hotels in the world and it always feels like coming back home here. Stayed for a weekend as needed a get-away from the cold of the fast approaching winter.  The hotel front desk are terrific - Priyanka, Mahesh, Gaurav and Shruti made sure I had everything I needed and quickly resolved any issues I encountered.  If you need a massage after a long journey, head down to the Quan Spa and book a treatment with Rupesh. This therapist has got the hands of God and you would walk out a brand new person after a session with him.  Breakfast was plentiful and I over-indulged on dosas and parathas. Chef Binu (apart from many other chefs there) introduced me to a few local dishes, and generally made sure I was well looked after.  A big shout out to everyone in the"
617,Swimming pool and Jacuzzi was amazing. Food-spread was good. We enjoyed our stay . Rooms were well kept and clean. Proximity to Juhu beach and the separate short-cut was good to use. Had visited the ISKCON temple which again was close to the Hotel.
618,"Great hotel, helpful and happy staff, always smiling and greeting you. Had an excellent buffet dinner last night and a banquet brunch this morning. So many dishes for vegetarians and chef able to accommodate egg free dishes on request. We had a number of Gujarati and local Mumbai dishes and a few egg free pastries. Masala chai is delicious and a waiter comes around with small glasses and a large tea kettle and he serves at your table. Also recommended is the fresh watermelon juice. The hotel has lovely grounds around the pools but too hot to go to the beach."
619,Throughout my travels in India I must comment on the wonderful attention offered by the staff at this Marriott location.   My dinning expectations have always been exceeded.   I must personally commend Chef Vineet as to his personal attention to my tastes and dietary needs.
620,"Stayed here for 4 days. Excellent location along side the Juhu seashore. Building is very old but structure is very open with a lot of sunshine coming into the building and room. Food was great and the chef, whose name is Vineet, was very accommodating and even offered to cook the spaghetti that was not in the buffet menu. Great service. One down-side is that the room was very dirty. I noticed a lot of dusts on the floor when i first got in the room. The building is old and I do not expect new and immaculate room but it's just the flood was very dirty. Dusts close to the window were shining reflecting the sun. I asked the cleaner to clean up and it was immediately done but still the dusts were around everywhere. The cleaners must have swiped with the mop with a lot of wet dusts"
621,"The room was not clean when we arrived.  The Mini bar was not filled every day and just the bare minimum even not fruit juice.  The same for the capsule of coffee and tea which not replaced daily. I ve also asked for some  sleepers as mine was keeped in the SPA .  When ON THE WAY to leave the hotel ,  we waited nearly 45 minutes for baggage service for coming to  take luggage from the room.  Then we had booked the car to the airport 8 h in advance and to the appoint of departure the concierge  said first also that no  vehicle is available then just a small car or we had difficulties to put our suitcases. The concierge was very rude also departure with a rudeness as he also shouted  me in front of many other customers to make the check out ! When I told me that it was already"
622,"We have just returned from our visit to the JW Marriott Juhu in October 2018 - our third visit to the hotel. All three visits have been a memorable and enjoyable experience and a feeling like a home away from home! Excellent location and extremely friendly staff who are always available to help. A special thank you to Hashmeet (Front-desk Reception), Priyesh and Rony (Executive Lounge), Chef Tanmesh, Chef Binu and Akshay (Lotus Cafe), Shrikant (Restaurant Manager), Gaurav (Director Food & Beverage) and Sumesh (House Keeping) for their welcoming hospitality and exceptional service. We hope to visit again very soon! Our best wishes for Diwali and happy new year! Best Regards from the Shah Family."
623,"I stayed 4 nights in this wonderful hotel.It is a 5-star hotel in every aspect, really excelled! The room (deluxe) is fabulous and has every possible detail to make your stay enjoyable. The impeccable service with a helpful staff, smiling and attentive to the needs of the guest. The SPA is fantastic, breakfast is amazing in choice, quality and presentation. In short, it is definitely the hotel to choose if you happen to visit Mumbai - it's just perfect!"
624,We visited this cafe on a friend‚Äôs recommendation and were not disappointed. JW cafe offers different cuisine food stations for everyone. We didn‚Äôt try all the food station as we were so full due to so much food options on offer. The cafe is quite spacious and the cafe staff are very attentive. We loved the atmosphere in this hotel and intent to stay here on our next visit. Thanks for the experience!
625,"A 90 minute massage for us was extremely rejuvenating and one steps out feeling as good as new. A must visit, if and when in Mumbai. From the time you are received and prepared - until you are all robes and seen off, an experience worth noting in a personal diary."
626,"I must compliment the hotel staff @ the JW Marriott, JUHU, Mumbai, India. From Phoebe at Front desk reception who graciously re-accomodated my room request without hesitation. To the  welcoming staff at the front desk. And most definitely Chef Binu @ the Lotus Cafe! He was  friendly, professional, helpful & extremely accommodating! His warm & friendly smile warmed the hearts of me and my colleagues. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. And I loved the room views, even @ night."
627,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel, and this time it was better than the first.  Shabaz checked us in and it was swift, he was friendly and very professional.  The room was great! Newly renovated and very clean and spacious.  Coming from another hotel which was incredibly noisy the peaceful and restful sleep we got at the JW was welcomed!   Breakfast was superb as well as the spa experience.  Will most certainly return!"
628,Please do not take this membership by any chance.   They are cheats and have hygiene issues as the buffet in the desserts section had insects and flies crawling over the cakes.   In the pool I was stung badly by a wasp and the pool manager had no response for the same.   During the stay the room had a broken shower and no hot water.   The next room the tv was not working and the coffee maker had electrical issues.   They change the pool rules arbitrarily and cheat members.   All these feedback is given and they are calling back for a renewal shamelessly.
629,I love the Jw Marriott Juhu . It is my home away from home . I have stayed the longest this time around  and absolutely loved it . From the staff at the hotel to the Resturant‚Äôs and exectiuve lounge  service was amazing  .I would like to recognize some people that really made my stay very special . At the front desk Mahesh Anand and Akshaya Dixit the wonderful Managers who really took care of me and my every request . They were very Profesional and polite .  The Guest relation staff Amen had always a smile on he face and made me feel very special.  In the house keeping  department Michale and Taraka were always taking care of what I  needed . In the lotus Cafe  Paragh  always waiting to serve me my tea and breakfast  every morning. .  I love the Indian hospitality . I can‚Äôt wait
630,"Just returned home after a 4 night stay and can‚Äôt thank you enough for our great stay- great check in , executive lounge and room were fantastic  Staff and service were spot on, a special thank you to AD ( Aditya) who made a massive effort to bring us special foods to try every night. All dining room staff were fab   Concierge arranged a car for us to take a tour of Mumbai promptly which was a great service   Overall a great hotel I only have two negatives as people have mentioned previously there are a lot of birds which congregate around the pool - staff could do with cleaning up after them more often and trying to prevent them with some form of bird scarer or pest control method and secondly butter should be available at the morning buffet we had to ask every morning which"
631,"A fine hotel. Comfortable rooms, lovely lobby, very good restaurants, great views of the Arabian Sea, and all in a very nice part of Mumbai. Why struggle with the traffic and crowds in Colaba, when you can relax in Juhu."
632,"Very bad and disappointing service for booking banquet hall..I called for booking the banquet hall.. They just sent a mail.. No one even ready to discuss anything further. Even after repeated requests, no one even called..eventually booked at taj lands end.. taj is taj.. Excellent service.. Just after calling once the assistant manager AT TAJ regularly called me up and called me for discussion and closed in flat 2 days.. Wanted to book marriot as the ambience is good.. But after this experience.. NEVER.."
633,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times but on my most recent visit I was disappointed by service and standard.   The staff fail to provide a personal or even polite service. After seeing people pushing in front of me whilst waiting to check in, the staff continued to serve the person that pushed in.  the rooms are incredibly small.  The only saving grace for this hotel in the breakfast."
634,Its all about service standards at such places (the front desk in this case) ... And when the expected is below that... It becomes disappointing... And when the issue raised is not even acknowledged... It becomes a very disappointing experience !!!
635,"A very nicely done hotel with nice rooms A see view,good for family stays Great swimming pool a very nicely dine Spa,Ms.Gunjan is really taking efforts to give the best spa experienc,good sumptuous buffet."
636,"The experience here is definitely a bit Jekyll & Hyde. Inside the hotel, the service is second to none. No request is too demanding, the food is outstanding and thehotel and room interiors are lovely.  Then you go outside. At first view the hotel pool area also looks beautiful. But on closer examination the whole pool margin area is covered with pigeon faeces, left by the flocks of pigeons which congregate undisturbed around the pool. These faeces are then washed into the pool by the backwash from swimmers. If this pool was in Europe Environmental Health would have it shut down.  No attempt is made by hotel staff to scare off the pigeons nor in any of my visits, to clean the poolside or the sun loungers.  A real shame, as I said, since inside the hotel is great."
637,I was speechless with the friendliness and service of the staff.  So many names to mention but here are just a few  1. Alok Verma - main chef - wonderful person truly devoted to his work and genuinely interested in guests' needs - nothing was too much trouble  2. Binu Matthew - another chef - very hospitable and caring   3. Shivangi Prehan - in charge of bakery - made some amazing sugar-free sweets which was very thoughtful of her  4. Gunjan Chawla - head of the spa - very thoughtful and helpful in selecting spas and taking care of all matters.   All the staff in the Lotus cafe - especially Rahul who served us with entuhusiam and in the Executive Lounge - Chingla for her wonderful service.  Also special thanks to Vikas Arora who went out of his way to source a memory foam pillow
638,This Hotel I stayed in Dec 17 for two days. This is one of best  Marriot hotels I have stayed. Because of  Family Member Platinum status upgraded to  executive suite which was very spacious and luxurious.  Service was very good.  Breakfast was delicious .
639,"I was delighted by staff's courtesy extended at every occasion, it was like everyone was trying hard to increase the experience for me, starting from check in to check out, room services, food, general queries etc all perfect to score 10. Everything is upto the standard of 5 star stay."
640,"We stayed for 5 nights with friends and had a fantastic time.   The city was full of energy and a bit chaotic so it was always nice to return to what felt like home by the end of our stay.  Special thanks to:  Ashang, Rony, Kunal, Chingla and Pryesh in the lounge area.  Roshan and Gitesh at Dashanzi for an amazing meal with superb desert.   Livi, Shashikala, Vrushali, Fifi and everyone else in the spa.  Vaibhav in Lotus Cafe.   Sorry if I missed anyone - you were all wonderful, I just couldn't catch your name. :-)"
641,I have stayed at this property a few times before. There are some problems but I overlooked them. The last time  8/22-8/24 was totally disappointing.  1: I was given a room with not even water bottles at check-in. Now I don‚Äôt even know if the room was cleaned or sheets changed. It‚Äôs frustrating to check in to the rooms where you don‚Äôt provide water bottles? This is a 5 star experience? 2: There is a constant renovation work going on from several months. It was still manageable before. Last stay was frustrating. There is so much smell of paint and dust all over the lobby and lift area. Its suffocating to walk through those corridors from the lift to the room. Why can‚Äôt you give guests rooms on floors that are actually clean and maintained? We stay for a couple of nights come back
642,"Being in one of the most beautiful locations in Mumbai, facing the sea and close to all the local haunts is a huge puss point. Great for business meetings, as the staff is super helpful & courteous. From Sheldon and his team helping us all the way to make our conference as smooth as possible. Whereas Mehul, Sarfaraz & his team made sure the check in was smooth (150pax) and in an orderly fashion. Their breakfast restaurant Lotus and their poolside cafe is worth a visit. My favourite being the Bombay baking co (BBC) with it's ever helpful staff (lead by Sachin and Arsalan, Ravi, Reshma & Pabita) seeing to all your needs with a smile."
643,"Recently I visited JW Marriott to celebrate my birthday at Dashanzi restaurant. The experience was unique, very professional service, the F&B manager Bensan took care of every single detail, with the assistance of Mehanshi (my apologies, probably I spell the name wrong) and chefs. The moment we arrived we got cocktails at the bar, which are very creative and tasty. Later we tried their menu which was delicious and the night closed with a playful ""happy birthday"" surprise. Just a perfect evening from a fantastic team!"
644,"If you haven't visited or if it's been a while, your missing a great secret paradise. Step within the hotel grounds and the senses can take you wherever you want to go in the world. Especially fantastic cuisine thanks to executive Sous Chef Alok Verma and his team."
645,"One place you should always go when possible is because of the diversity and innovation in the food menu. They keep introducing new dishes every now and then making it always interesting for everyone coming in regularly. Food is awesome, Service is super quick and polite. Ambiance is simply outstanding. I am sure you will want to visit again and again just like I do."
646,"Stayed here for 4 nights recently on a business trip and really enjoyed it. For me location was ideal; close to the airport, not in the south, not in the north, kind of the middle. Check-in was done on the mobile app and my key was ready when I arrived. I had a room on the 2nd floor, lounge is on the 4th. My room didn‚Äôt have a view of the pool or ocean but it was very comfortable and quiet. Comfy bed and all of the standard Marriott amenities, except I never received any body lotion during my stay. Started to wonder if they even offered it at that property.  The hotel is huge and is quite popular with locals (meetings, events, brunch, weddings, etc). The brunch on Sunday was so crowded I couldn‚Äôt even eat there. Settled for the Bombay Baking Company, which quickly turned into my"
647,I have visited with my girl and the room which i found that was completely sightseeing of the sea face and that was lovely So advise to all of my user that visit je marriot when you come mumbai its a best place
648,Stayed here for a recent business trip.  Food at the hotel was outstanding and the staff was exceptional.   The breakfast buffet was very good and the five course dinner at Saffron was a nice experience. Good workout facilities and pool area.  Very nice hotel.
649,"I am a regular guest of this hotel but this time the stay was not that good n comfortable. The staff was not courteous enough to know about my needs. I had terrible issues with in room dining. The services by housekeeping and in room dining were terribly slow. Even at the time of check out I tried to give a notice about my zero satisfaction, person on front desk just said sorry. I paid my bill n left. Anyways I might not be a part of this hotel again but definitely not Marriott standards. The lotus cafe and Bombay baking company staff is phenomenal, atleast the hotel staff can learn from them.  I stayed here on 30/09/2018."
650,"The most beautifully luxurious hotel in Mumbai and my personal favorite. The hospitality is so good that it feels better than home. Would recommend this hotel to everyone for the delicious food it serves. The more you visit, the more you'll fall in love with the sea view and ambience."
651,Had lunch at this lovely place the restaurant is lovely and it is near the pool which is a infinity pool and you can see the Arabian sea and this view is so amazing. its a breathtaking one and you will love it. the food was also great and they have a amazing spread of collection and i loved the continental section.
652,Just a great property. Fantastic location in Mumbai. Great rooms. Great pool and gym. Fun and cool people always around. Breakfast is awesome. The executive lounge is a special place. Service and view are unmatched. One of your best options to stay in Mumbai.
653,"Wonderful property lavish style and Ambiance awesome in heart of Mumbai. As always Food variety and taste awesome  Staff too warm and friendly and pamper you during Buffets morning or evening! Amenities wonderfully designed, pool huge and gives royal looks. Best part of hotel is the proximity to sea beach as its situated on beach side, one can easily walk through to beach and enjoy sea!"
654,Really good place to stay! Great atmosphere and amazing staff! I think the team here are so helpful and that s what makes it a pleasant place to visit. Saif at reception - always happy to help and great person. We had taken a break in between our 4 day stay as we had to travel to Gujarat and the hotel was happy to store our luggage.  Food at the lotus cafe/breakfast - delicious! And once again accompanied by great service (Thank you Rahul and Kaustubh!)  Special thank you to Sandesh and his house keeping team - we misplaced some items in our room when we checked out the first time and they had safely stored with lost and found when we came back - very honest and hard working team!
655,Great place. Excellent rooms. Well maintained and clean. Good ambiance. Close proximity to good eating places. Hotel has good eating options as well.  Buffet breakfast has good options including healthy eating options.
656,"I have to say this hotel is on top of my list. Fantastic service,  a 5 star for cleanliness, super friendly staff, great rooms...very spacious, lovely view of the beach. I think it's ideally located with shopping at your door step and also the international airport being just 30 mins away. Taxis are very easily available.  The breakfast here is to die for..... fresh hot croissants are my highlight... then there was a variety of stuffed parathas, dosas, Puri aloo and I could go on and on. Also you have to try their buffet... it is just awesome... a variety of cuisines to choose from....be ready to activate all your taste buds !! üòä I have to compliment Binu Mathew for the service with a smile and Pramit Konar, the chef.   The ambiance of the hotel is wonderful.... feels like a"""
657,Hi stayed at Marriott.  Had a amazing experience.  The  dashanzi bar staff where great especially dhiraj shetty.  I thought he was the manager.  Because he was so professional. I think he needs a promotion.  The D J named sandeep was fab! He played every song we requested. Would highly recommend this place .
658,The housing keeping team is the best in the world .... their gesture to offer me a Muslim prayer Matt was extremely nice and touching .... the front office team is one of the most helpful I have met any where in the world
659,My friend and I  visited the bar a few days ago and cannot speak highly enough about the staff at the bar and the DJs.So welcoming.Especially Dhiraj Shetty.Lovely lovely guy who made us feel very welcome  Minal and Sam
660,"I stayed for 3 nights and the room, the service, and the food were all fine. There is a beach but I never walked out there - it is Mumbai and not the most inviting beach. Local area has shops and restaurants, and overall I was pleased with the convenience. The pool seems nice but instead I used the gym, which is excellent. I have seen the other hotels in Juhu, but in my opinion, this is the best."
661,"My wife and I recently stayed at the hotel for a month - the second long stay there this year.  It is an excellent hotel -  but special mention must go to Sumeet, Kaustubh, Priyanka and Rahul (Bhai) in the Lotus Caf√© for they were a joy and looked after us with a politeness and kindness that went beyond the obligations of their jobs.  They all deserve promoting!  On our day of departure we did try to tip them for the care they had provided - but they all refused.  One, not insignificant, complaint:  on the day I checked out I requested that I pay my bill in rupees.  When I returned home I discovered that I had been billed in sterling which, because of the hotel's usurious exchange rate, was significantly more expensive that it should have been.  This shouldn't happen."
662,"I‚Äôve never written a review but felt compelled to do so after visiting the Juhu Marriott. I can honestly say I had the most wonderful experience and received impeccable customer service. We stayed in room 562 for about five days and just left on Saturday and I cannot stop thinking about how wonderful my time was. The staff were very attentive without being annoying and every thing I had requested was responded to immediately.  The cleaning staff were delightful; I never really got to meet them but they‚Äôd leave little things daily for my one year old son, such as balloons or towels placed as animals.  The breakfast staff were also truly accommodating and made me feel very welcomed every breakfast, especially Kaustaubh. Next time I am to visit India I would without a doubt stay"
663,"I didn‚Äôt enjoy my stay here and definitely won‚Äôt be back. I tried to change hotels but it was too short notice, the nearby hotels were fully booked. I chose this hotel for the view but my room (an executive club) although listed as ocean view in reality only had a partial view. Despite attempting to check in ~17:00 (i.e. 2 hours after check-in commenced) I had over an hours wait. Then my suitcase went missing, it took over two hours to be re-united with it. It was obvious the room (420) had not been cleaned properly just quickly straightened up. I noticed a pair of slippers by the bed and assumed that was part of the turn down service until closer inspection revealed that they were a used pair. The room was just dirty, there were stains across all of the hotel literature, the"
664,Just now I checked in the hotel. - It took 1 hour to get keys. - Waiting since 30 mins still didn't get the luggage. - Fail to contact reception because all of them are busy assisting others. Stay at this hotel not  worth at all.
665,"As always, I think business hotels focus on facilities rather than the more warm elements of a lovely welcome. Thankfully, such behaviours does not apply to this hotel. I was welcomes with wonderful smiles and will most definitely stay there again. Definitely worth the visit for amenities, food, and all round hospitality."
666,"One of the best hotels near the airport in Mumbai, very nice room, very often they give an upgrade of the room. Breakfast is top notch, pancakes, eggs every way you want! Very easy checkin and checkout!"
667,"This is my second review and this I am writing after staying nearly 70+ nights in last two years. Property location is no doubt very good. It has an ambience and upkeep like of an resort. But over the last 2 years, I have seen a consistent degradation in the services and issues in the billing. Whenever I had taken any other paid services like Laundry, there were always billing issues. Hotel staff is getting replaced like play cards. Every time you see a new face. I am surprised on such a high attrition rate of employees. Nevertheless its management call. But couple of things which I have been experiencing : Focus of hotel is now more on bulk bookings and grand ceremonies. Nearly zero focus on their loyal customers. Its not me who feels so, but its general perception across the"
668,I have travelled all over the world but my experience at JW Mariott Juhu Mumbai is beyond expectations. A very well located hotel in Mumbai. Amazing ambience and a very good food. The staff makes you feel very much like home. Very welcoming and polite. I must make a mention of Chef Binu Mathews from the Lotus cafe and also Chef Shivangi. They made sure that we had variety in our choice of foods. They were like family always there for us with their warmth and efficient service.Highly recommend this hotel for any tourist passing through Mumbai.
669,"We have been to Lotus Cafe, nice Ambience, decor was great, from the start till end Everything was just Too Good, Servers we're very polite and professional enough they took good care of us, food was too good...."
670,"JW Marriott has been my home away from home in India.  I have been treated like family every time I walk into their doors. The staff is incredible and has gone out of their way to both help and serve me in the countless times I have now stayed there. There are too many to name, but Akshaya and Sarfraz at the front desk are exceptional. The concierge and bell desk team are wonderful. Gunjan and her team at the spa are excellent.  The dining staff and team at Bombay Baking company like Stefan, are all like family.  I cannot thank the staff at this hotel enough for making JW Juhu feel like my home.  It‚Äôs also the most beautiful premise with amazing grounds, beautiful rooms, a wonderful spa and an infinity pool the edge of Juhu beach.  I love this hotel and couldn‚Äôt recommend it"
671,"Spacious rooms with limited sea view. And long walk from elevators. Too much traffic outside. But once in, it's an oasis in desert. Too much crowd on Sunday for brunch. Parking is away from hotel, so waiting time is more."
672,"Was there for 2 days for a corporate event, hotel is at a superb location just in front of Juhu beach. JW brand is synonymous enough for the service being offered at this place, what is cherry on icing is that far side rooms have a breath taking view of the beach, specially the 4th and 5th floors. Food is good should definitely visit their main restaurant situated at Lower Lobby and their their roasted chicken, if you are a non-veg."
673,"My only go to place when I come to Mumbai. The staff here are fantastic, from check-in, to during our stay and check out, I can fault none. I would like to give a special thanks to chef Binu Matthews who went way above and beyond our expectations. We were fasting on one of the days and, on the very same day travelling out of the city in the early mornings, where he had offered and delivered our falhari breakfast before we departed at 6.00am, which was an impeccable gesture. Housekeeping - Jose did a great job during turn down. Ruchira Todankar who checked us out left me with a great smile while I left the hotel.  The team here made me and my family feel like home. Thank you very much for your hospitality!   Anisha Kunvarji"
674,"Only one word to describe this structure: stunning. The hotel is amazing, the service even better. The pool area, right on the beach, it's outstanding. The staff is professional, helpfull and friendly. The room was clean and tidy with a very interesting bathroom set. Breakfast was amazing. You shall try the Sunday brunch... No words to describe it. If you are ready to pay the right price, you will enjoy an unforgettable stay."
675,Such a grt place wid the warm Welcome from Rahul and Aman !!! Thanks guys !!!! Highly recommend for people who Loved the continental !!!! The atmosphere amzing !!! The menu very simple and prices are very reasonable
676,"My name is Rabia Jakhura and I‚Äôve been a guest at JW Marriott Mumbai for the past two years. It is the warmth and welcoming from the hotel staff that makes me want to come back every year. I will list a few names of all the people who really made my family and I feel special and always give their 101 % I‚Äôm making guests feel welcome.  Below are some names of the staff at JW Marriott that make the hotel and deserve some sort of incentive.   Lotus Cafe: Satish. Anil,Shivam, Bal Krishna, Sumeet, Vijay, Priyanka, Aishwarya, Roshni, Tarandeep  Chef Alok and Chef Quddus- absolutely amazing and they gave us the most memorable experience and warmth we‚Äôve experienced anywhere. I cannot wait to come back and see you chefs. They‚Äôre so good I might steal them from Marriott and open my own"
677,First of all I liked the environment and the situation of the hotel. Great service nice suite great amenities. I liked it all though it was a little out priced could be a bit less but though speaking a great hotel.
678,"On my way to Berlin, via bangalore and mumbai, on business, I stayed at this superb hotel for one night. It was organised by my business associates and I was always looking forward to my stay at this very amazing hotel.  This is without a doubt a celebrity style hotel, celebrating the very essence of magical Mumbai, Mumbaikars and Bollywood. So much so that, within that one night stay, the hotel staff showed my a few Bollywood stars and Indian cricketers who were at the restaurants. This hotel is filled with sights and sounds and mesmerising mumbai magic.  Superb food. The kitchen department is easily one of the best in the world. Especially the Indian cuisine, a brilliant variety of dishes are made from the heart. Wow.  Very comfortable rooms. Well designed. Extremely good and"
679,"So the hotel location is perfect, however there are a few things about this place that just did not sit well with me. Firstly, it's India and everyone and their grandmother is getting married so I understand that the hotels are busy with weddings, but waking up at 5:30am to loud music from the next room over was not a pleasurable way for me to start my trip especially when I landed at 1am and finally got to sleep about 2:30am. The thing that bothered me was when I called the front desk( all three times) there was not sense of emergency to do anything about this. It took them 45mins to send someone up to ask the guy next door to turn off this music. Secondly, the hotel has a huge buffer section in the lower level which is open to the main lobby area, in the evening he entire"
680,We r enjoy them bar and restaurant it‚Äôs awesome place to spend time with friends.we enjoy lots them service and food.they give us superb service in bar and restaurant I recommend to go there atlist once so u understand what is the service
681,visited with friends in this hotel for dinnerand had an amazing experience.wonnderful ambience wonderfulfood and most importantly the best staff.starting from the main entrance till the restaurant everyone were amazing
682,Rooms are excellent. Breakfast was awesome with lots of option. It has own entry for visit to beach and its very clean. Only the occupant of the room can enter the activity area. Fitness equipment are of high quality. Staff are very courteous
683,"This place is on the expensive side but if you get a good deal, it may be worth it. The lunch buffet has a great variety and the hotel ambience and staff service is good. The location of the pool near the beach is a big plus."
684,Dinner at lotus cafe was an amazing experience Rahul Mishra and Satish Rajat   who were serving us was very cooperative and good with their services The food was very good as well even the ambeince is very nice.
685,"This was my my second stay at Marriott Juhu . Rooms are big, staff is good and restaurants are amazing specially zafraanüòç . Many shops are nearby plus good restaurants and cafes. Also Bandara is close by and infinity mall as well. So if you are looking for relaxation and shopping.. Marriott is the place üëçüèª"
686,I stayed here on my first trip to India.  The hotel is old but in good condition and it looks like some of the rooms has been renovated.  My room had a view of the beach but its not recommended for swimming.  The pools look good.  The breakfast buffet was impressive and as expected the staff were excellent.
687,Everything absolutely stunning from the service down to the last detail  Such friendly staff loved it would stay here if i could  totally recommend this amazing place - shivam druvi and akshay best waiters and aslo the beautiful tarandeep ‚ù§Ô∏è
688,The food and service were excellent.  Everyone was very attentive and hospitable.  I thought a dish was too salty and the chef prepared a something special for me the next day. Sundeep and Herbert were especially great in the bar.  I was working until late every night and they made sure that I was comfortable and well taken care of :)  The only partial negative is the front desk staff were slow and not very well informed.  The Bell desk staff was very helpful.
689,"Worst hotel among the JW I have stayed so far. Upon asking sea facing room they gave me a corner room (wasn't a completely sea facing) it was very ordinary room, seemed as if it's a three star hotel. No bath tub. In the food, there was hair, in the water glass there was a mosquito. They tried to make up but....."
690,"We have been a regular patron with JW Marriott, Juhu. For 8 years now. This year we even went ahead and took the Club Membership for the entire family.  We have been highly impressed by the service, until recently, since one Mr Datta has joined as F&B manager at Lotus.  He, for some reason, seem to have personal strife against my family eating Lunch/Dinner or Breakfast. On every occasion, he has made the experience unpleasant, by being rude, unattentive and opposing every request as 'not in policy', something as simple as my 7 years old daughters left over on breakfast was asked to pack. (while this was going on for every other table except on ours it became a 'no policy')  and for 2 mini paratha served during breakfast was charged separately at INR 1950, whereas the buffet"
691,"I had the pleasure of having an aromatherapy facial with Maharashtra yesterday. What a facial!!  It was the best I‚Äôve ever had. The products were exemplary and she provided a professional, luxurious experience."
692,The staff here is so clueless about any information. I was booked in for a day and told the man at the reception that I might be extending my stay. He informed me that I can let him know at my convinience. After a busy day of work I come back around late noon and inform the reception that I would be extending my stay. And I'm blatantly told that I will not be able to because they were running full. If there was such a huge occupancy then I think I should've been informed of it when I asked about the extension in the first place. Not when I've already changed my tickets thinking I could extend my hotel stay as well. Now I am left with a staff that is the least bit interested in solving this issue nor do they care about the satisfaction of the guest. Honestly I did not expect this
693,JW marriot properties are always the best in every city and state of India. I am from chandigarh. The hotel in mumbai is nice and has some great lobby area along with the suitable comfort seating . The staff has a nice attitude towards its customers I had spent around 3-4 hours here having a meal with my family members some years back.. The tea which they serve is best in town but the rates were touching sky . But we cant do anything its the most beautiful hotel in mumbai so we need to pay the bill.. Overall the hotel has alot to offers to the public .
694,"I spent almost a year living at this hotel for work, it was a wonderful place to stay. The staff are top notch and always looking to make your stay an amazing one. I definitely recommend the JW Marriott in Juhu."
695,"Service is impeccable, From checking to Check out.  The Food is Excellent. Breakfast buffet is absolutely Delicious. If your a platinum member the lounge is beautiful. This is the best food I‚Äôve had at any Marriot lounge. If you come to Mumbai it‚Äôs the only place to stay."
696,"We were here for our vacations and were disappointed by their food and staff services. The food was not up to the mark and the staff was not cooperative n guest friendly. We had to ask  at least 4-5 times to get one roti. The staff was very less in number and were not able to reach every table.  The rooms and the other things were up to the mark.  Recently we visited courtyard Marriott International Airport.   The food, the staff , the services n everything was far more better than JW Marriott Juhu.  Our only concern for JW Marriott is to improve the food and increase the staff for providing better services."
697,"Really enjoyed our family dinner, at Dashanji. We were celebrating my wife‚Äôs birthday and cudnt have chosen a better place. The food, ambience, service .. everything was impeccable. Bensan Varghese- asst manager & his team made it even more special. DJ Sandeep played super music and we had a fantastic evening. Definitely worth a visit."
698,"Have been to Mumbai multiple times and have stayed in multiple hotels over the years but since the last two years have stayed at Marriott, Juhu three times because it consistently overshadows all other hotels. Location is excellent...close to the airport and at the centre of modern Mumbai, reasonably distanced from south as well as north Mumbai. For those who like beaches, Marriott is literally a footstep away from Juhu Beach (not that Juhu is the greatest beach in the world !) Check-in is fast and smoother than James Bond !(must mention Saniya at Front Desk here, who was quick, efficient and friendly) .The view of the sea from the suite was breathtaking.The suite itself was comfort personified. For a change, five-star hotel food was delicious and the whole experience was"
699,I had a really nice 2 and a half week stay at the JW Marriott Juhu.  I would like to thank the staff for a very nice room that they gave me overlooking the beach.  The room was very well kept by housekeeper Siddarth.  He and his management team make sure that I was well taken care of and they kept the room very clean and made sure I had what I needed.  I was very well looked after by Kunal from the Executive Lounge.  He is a very personable and caring individual and made sure that I was happy and had what I needed.  He takes care of his guests and is such a joy to have around and see every day.  He truly cares for the guests as evidenced by the little things that he did for me during my stay after he learned about my preferences and likes.  The chefs at the various restaurants
700,"I routinely stay at this location and have never been disappointed. It is typically my first hotel after a long flight to India, and it is a reliable, comfortable, and relaxing location to recover before days of business and further travel. I usually book a room with executive lounge access. This bundles a complimentary limo ride from the airport in the price. Arrangements are made through the concierge and my only suggestion to Marriott is to make the concierge‚Äôs contact information more readily available on the Marriott web site. I now have the information stored in my iPhone ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù, but getting through otherwise requires a bit of patience and perseverance. The outdoor pool (photo attached) is excellent, as is the fitness center, Saffron (their Indian restaurant),"
701,"I visit  the Quan Spa almost everyday after work and i am greeted by happy smiling faces everytime. Fantastic service provided every day by Karuna, Livi and Mahesh.  They make a visit to the Spa very Special."
702,"We celebrated birthday of a family member last week. There was special Onam menu. It was outstanding food. Onam sadya as they say. Kuttu, pysam, avial was fantastic. Battery of dessert s made the meal complete"
703,"We were at the Lotus Cafe for brunch today and God, what A display! The sheer variety is bound to make one feel satisfied. There‚Äôs literally nothing that you could want that they don‚Äôt offer right there.   Their seating is in an expansive open room over looking a meandering pool that makes for a lazy brunch setting. The vibes of the place are extremely friendly and fun loving. The hospitality is welcoming and the service is quick and efficient.   Coming to the spread of food, I‚Äôll take my time to explain Coz the King sized meal must get it‚Äôs due attention. I‚Äôm going to write in the order that I would like to consume my meal, feel free to rearrange in your head as per your own order:   1. Charcuterie: one could start at the cold cut section with pastrami or plain old chicken ham"
704,Checked in and thought it‚Äôs a 5 star but being used to North American hotels this was a night mare. The lady at the check in counter didn‚Äôt know a thing and then this same lady and others end up in the lounge which was so awkward and non welcoming. We‚Äôre here for 3 days hopefully it ends well. Am looking forward to trying other jw properties as this one was a hospitality fail.
705,"Hotel is clean, well-appointed Fitness Centre has an impressive Centralized Coffee shop (Lotus) in the middle of the lower lobby level with a beautiful view of Pool and landscaping. Live Indian classical music during the Breakfast hours. Breakfast food and service is great. However, I had a disappointing episode at Lotus during the dinner service on 21 August 2018 when I found a hair in the Salad buffet when I drew the attention of the Chef Paramjeet, he was very casual in saying ""This an open buffet, it can happen."" This negative attitude of the staff is disgusting and Hotel needs to look into the matter very seriously."
706,"After parting we decided to go for coffee/desert at 2 am. The 1st thought came was JW Marriott Juhu- Lotus cafe, logically it would be open 24 hours. We ordered some ice creams and coffee. I would really appreciate the team at 2 am on 23 August Night. We ordered for extra choco chips to add, they literally gave up a bowl full of them and as they realized it was our birthday, they gave us cake which was so yum.... it was a perfect birthday for me as I was celebrating with my friend after a very long time. I would really say Lotus Cafe Hospitality was to its best. Amazing team well I am looking for my up coming stay with them soon"
707,"I visit the Lotus Cafe 2-3 times a month and it is more like coming home to family rather than a hotel restaurant.   It‚Äôs amazing that they remember what I enjoy eating and I don‚Äôt have to order.... it‚Äôs already waiting.   Vikram is always smiling.   Siddesh, Kamstubh,Rahul Raman and Noel are always attentive and polite.   Best service in Mumbai"
708,"The first stop, on our first trip to India, the JW Marriott Mumbai made for an ideal introduction to what can otherwise be an intense and intimidating city.  The sprawling grounds, opulent open spaces, and attentive staff come as a welcome reprieve from the chaos of the city.  Although the grounds are stunning, the staff at the JW Marriott Mumbai was the true standout. In particular-- Emily and Ateyla in the Spa, Chef Bahrin at the main restaurant and our waiter Keshaf all went out of their way to make our stay a bit more memorable. Thank you.  Direct access to the beach is provided via a gated entryway in the back of the hotel; however, after a quick stroll up and down the sand, we were perfectly content lounging by one of the hotels three pools.   As we learned the hard way"
709,"For a reunion with very dear college friends I booked a weekend stay at the Marriott. I am a club member so got a discount. We were 3 of us and wanted to share a room and have the best time. I only requested them for a sea facing room because I knew we'd spend hours chatting away. They said they couldn't commit but would try their best.  So the day arrived, we were well received and yes given a sea facing room!!!!The check in was hassle free and we went straight to Lotus cafe and had delicious coffees and a pizza. There were flowers and a cake left in the room welcoming us. We couldn't have been happier. The view from the room was beautiful...The room itself was lovely and the bathroom really large and comfortable.  We had the superb buffet breakfast where Mr. Prabhakaran and"

From the very first day to the last day of our stay, the staff went over and beyond their duty to ensure that our needs were met and that we had a comfortable stay. ad  From the concierge, to the reception, to the Spa, the Lotus Caf√© staff and the room service staff. I would like to say a particular thanks to Oneill, Priyanka and Roshni in the Lotus Caf√© and the man who provided room service and was so attentative when cleaning our room daily. Apologies I have forgotten his name (it began with S).  When my daughter was ill, Oneill cooked up a special dish for her on the spot. When I praised one of the dishes to Roshni on my last day, I received a take away box later on with that dish and a very sweet message. No chores or requests"
712,excellent location with beach view rooms.spacious rooms.nice spa and health centre.food is good though expensive.staff is helping.ambience and services are good.chances to see bollywood stars.juhu chowpaty at a walking distance.
713,"The dining experience at the Lotus Caf√© and Saffron at JW Marriott, Juhu, was truly mesmerizing. The food quality is excellent, menu is very elaborate and well-presented. Atmosphere is very friendly. It's worth mentioning here the cook's dexterous skills accompanied by their cheerful and friendly nature. They not only served topmost quality food but also took feedbacks from various guests personally to further enhance their culinary skills. Chefs Tanmesh Dongare and Abdul Quddus and Binu Mathew deserve a special kudos for the same. A special mention here about the KETO food which was specially prepared and served. The keto food was nutritious as well as very very yummy. Definitely want to visit this place again."
714,"It's rare that I review a hotel, even more that I review the hotel during the stay! But before the hectic pace of life prevents me from getting this out there, I want to be sure to shout out to Pam in the Executive Lounge and to the Housekeeping staff at this hotel. Pam noticed yesterday morning that I had a small wound on my ankle, something that I myself didn't even see. Without prompting, she got me bandages and took very good care of me. And today, after a long day of work, she served me the nicest of wines while I continued to wrap up more work in the lounge.   Then, there's the housekeeping staff...They are fast, attentive, and have a keen eye for details. They noticed that I didn't have a mouse pad at my desk and left one for me to use and take as a gift...complete with a"

716,"Had a chance to visit the JW Marriott, Juhu, Mumbai on a lovely & rainy Sunday afternoon for their grand brunch at the beautiful Lotus Cafe. It was an absolute delight to be here and enjoy the view, live music & of course the FOOD. The menu is very well curated & it is limitless in terms of options - it is truly the world on your plate. The presentation techniques are beautiful and quality & taste is spot-on. The beverage options will leave you craving for more. Any more words would truly not do justice - hence uploading a few pictures of the food, drinks & ambiance. Everything that you can expect from a top notch luxury hotel restaurant - you will not be disappointed.

717,"First the good:  Ambiance is always the best on the weekends with live music and all... Herbert from Reflections bar took care of me and deserves a shout out... Keep the Bloody Marys coming pal!  Now the Critique:  The hallways are freaking freezing!! just a few degrees warmer please.. my daughter caught cold walking from the elevator to end of the hall where our room was... No lie! Another one is, we asked for our room to be serviced, as my baby had soiled a few diapers...  It was cleaned but the housekeeper left the garbage bag of diapers on our in-room sofa... Kind of defeated the purpose of cleaning our room... I didnt want to get the guy in trouble but the hotel mgmnt needs to know this happened. Otherwise , I love this hotel!"
718,Had a great meal at the Lotus Cafe when i visited for dinner. The food and view are both amazing! the staff is very courteous. This is the best hotel i have ever been too. Do visit and stay here. 5 STAR bliss!
719,"My family had dinner at the Lotus Cafe yesterday. We were truly impressed with Mr Prabhakar (one of the managers there). He was prompt in suggesting some good Ala Carte options to us and also ensured that the service was impeccable.   Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and most importantly the service. I could also see Mr Prabhakar helping other guests. Such warm service and good attitude is what impresses customers. So please keep up the good work. Well done Mr Prabhakar, Team Lotus Cafe and JWM."
720,"We had a lovely stay at the JW Marriott in Mumbai (Juhu).  We had a lovely welcoming when we arrived and in our room waiting for us on our celebration was a full cake and fresh flowers!  (I let the manager know we were celebrating).  The hotel is BEAUTIFUL!  So much to do there and we unfortunately didnt get to enjoy everything.    The spa was GREAT.  We had services in the salon and were pleased.    We ate at the asian restaurant and it was GREAT!  Wonderful service and although we did not order dessert, they brought out one of the best desserts we have every had!  It was so nice of them to take such great care of us.    When we went for lunch one day to the Bakery, we ordered our sandwiches togo.  They offered a tea or coffee and we politely said no thank you.  Then they came"
721,"I had heard that the JW Marriotts in Asia were in a different league than elsewhere, and the Marriott Mumbai Juhu proves it. 5 stars all the way around at this Marriott. Special kudos to the kitchen and restaurant crews, from the chefs all the way to the servers. Amazing food and service. C‚Äômon, 8 different curries plus gourmet dosas and parathas - at breakfast (!) - and that‚Äôs less than 1/4 of the buffet. Lunch even more delicious....Rooms and room service nice, too, but the food service is exceptional. - Steve"
722,"We don‚Äôt normally write reviews, however, in the case of the JW Marriott I really had to make an exception due to the sheer level of service, ambience and overall aura.   We travel the world and stay in 5*+ hotels and this hotel is right up there with the best.   I have to give a real heads up to Binu at the Lotus Cafe who really looked after us with some great food samples and invited us to some great food and drinks at Mezzo Mezzo, unfortunately, we were late on our last day and just couldn‚Äôt make it. Next Time!  We also have to give a special thanks To Shrikant the manager on duty my husband had an Issue and it was sorted quickly and professionally. So thanks for that.   Overall a wonderful stay and thanks to everyone.  Best Regards Shushma Verma"

725,"We stayed in hotel for 2 nights from 10th till 12th August and I must mention it was disappointing and unorganised.To start with we booked a premium room which includes premium lounge access and the reception staff Shawn completely denied that we booked the same and gave us delux room . He kept on denying that we do not have access to premium lounge and gave us room at first floor ,room no 137 which I think could have worse view ever overlooking building work and about 10 labourers looking at us .I was travelling with my daughter and mum and had to call 6 to 7 times to get room changed .Everytine we went to the room ,our keys did not worked which was unexpected from a 5 star hotel and we had to go to lobby to get new keys .Waiting at breakfast was for 20 min minimum.

727,"The Hotel, Staff, and Food are all Excellent.  The grounds of the hotel are Beautiful.  Outside of the hotel property is a different story all together. It is what one would expect of a busy city in India.  Controlled Chaos. And a bit dingy . Although the hotel is located on the Beach,  It Is not recommended that you stroll the Beach or touch the water. There is a great resturaunt right across the street called ""The Melting Pot"". Although you will be taking your own life in your hands crossing the street.txt Pedestrians do not have the right of way. The food is certainly worth the risk. And, the hotel is Highly Recommended."
728,"It was a reunion with Friends and the team at the hotel made it very special for us, Members like Nachiket, Jonathan, Amen, Prashanth, and a couple of other names that I am unable to recall now were extremely hospitable, Housekeeping services were excellent. They turned our room around, while we were at breakfast and the best part was that whenever I used to make a call from the room, they used to address me with my name atleast twice, felt great. The hotel is equipped with state of the art equipments, Lobby is beautiful, The Breakfast buffet was huge and splendid, walking at the Poolside is pure bliss.. Must visit for a great experience, will recommend others."
729,Dear SantoshM.   Thank you for looking after us. The room although small has been looked after and spectacularly clean.

While the hospital staff has been trying to get him in shape to travel back home, we have been commuting between the hospital and hotel daily.  The staff on the 4th floor, have been amazing during our stay.  Altering to our every need, inquiring if we would like to bring anything to the hospital.  We just wanted to let you know that chefs Akash, Kishor and Divyanshi were so very kind to make us anything we wanted.  Priyesh and Rony were impeccable in their service.

I will always remember the willingness of the staff to help my family and me during our many, many stays at the hotel. It takes a very special individuals to make JW the magnificent hotel that it is.

734,I visited this hotel in the month of July for business purpose. The inside interiors designed so elegantly. Also if you are fond of live music then Yes Live band performance you can enjoy while having your food.
735,Genuine interest from the people working there on your well being!proactive approach and friendly atmosphere.very clean rooms and top of the class service.hats off especially to Amen and Kunal for taking such a good care of me during my stay
736,Very good property. Old but well maintained. Staff and service is excellent. Location is perfect. Have beach access and good pool access. Food is very good. Rooms have great view of beach. Juhu beach is walking distance from here.
737,Had a nice stay with very good staffs . Being close to the beach was an added advantage. Location of the hotel is very good . Thanks to Priyanka Dutt for such a great hospitality. Will surely visit again on my next visit to Mumbai.

739,"The JW Marriott Juhu stands out like a pearl amidst the crowded streets of Bombay. Luxury and comfort seem abundant as the friendly staff leave no stone unturned in their service.  My husband and I went there for a holiday and enjoyed ourselves tremendously. We got welcome flowers, wine and a cake when the beautiful guest relations staff Ashang found out that we were newly married.   The property is clean. The only grievance I had was that the service is restaurants was slow. We ordered a pizza and ended up waiting for 40 minutes when there were very few people at the restaurant. Also during breakfast, even at the executive lounge, it took 20 minutes to receive my omelette given that there were just two other people in the lounge and that too after umpteen reminders on my end."
740,The experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left was fantastic. The attentive staff made sure our every request was met. The room was large & very comfortable with all the amenities you could want during your stay. The breakfast on the ground floor was amazing - wide variety of very good quality options
741,"Best place in Mumbai I would say. Its worth spending the money per night as you will feel in the end that its worth putting that money. The food here specially is very good, the service is fast, reliable and excellent."
742,"Very poor , food was universally bad . The manager has not eaten his own food . They have managed to drop standards to a new low .Counter staff goes missing to get bowls . Pizza is like a warm roti with vegetables and cheese."
743,Amazing hotel with excellent hospitality  Breakfast was awesome and service mind blowing  Chefs like shivangi was closely monitored and serviced the needs at breakfast table Mr Gaurav at Frontoffice was very helpful with  a nice smile Felt like eating and living at home Keep this spirit going  Regards DeveshMukhija  Room 144  From 23 to 25 th july 18
744,"I came here for Christmas - winter sunshine for the Brits. I loved every second, the room was normal. Nothing amazing but acceptable. The service however was amazing, couldn't fault the staff. And let's not forget the Christmas dinner!!!! I was shocked by how amazing it was, just like being back in England. There was a HUGE Christmas tree in the foyer and a selection of big ginger bread house's we could eat. The food (buffet) had everything and more you could dream of. And the champagne never stopped flowing.  A return visit for sure!!"
745,A bad experience with the lotus cafe  The staff were negligent on their part Less welcoming and least bothered They gave us our food but did not bother to serve us they just left it at the table and walked off until I told the manager to do so. 5 star‚Äôs are known for their hospitality and welcoming nature but yesterday I did not get any of it
746,Very nice hotel very good location very good staff only room size is medium otherwise very good experience  Love to stay again buffet breakfast is wonderful with full of variety.bathroom accessories also good  Thanks to management
747,"Surprisingly the rooms are tiny for a luxury 5 star hotel. Not a good start to my stay. However it was a Sunday and the hotel was buzzing to an extent that there was a traffic jam in the driveway. The lotus cafe is decent and so is the food from room service. The sea view from my room was decent, a partial view."
748,Best place in town for breakfast and all the other meals too !!! Really a very good place the food was awesome enjoyed the breakfast with live music had a great time with friends and family ! The quality of food is simply great
749,"I am glad that i chose JW Marriott Juhu to celebrate my 2nd wedding anniversary. From the moment i entered the hotel till the time i checked out there was not a single moment which i can complain about. The front desk staff is very courteous and they checked if i have come for any special occasion. After knowing its my anniversary and being a Marriott Gold member they upgraded me to the Presidential Suite. What can i say about that Suite, it really gave me a feeling of being a celeb. The suite was so grand and luxurious and had the best view of the ocean. Plus the hotel staff also sent out a cake and bottle of wine to help us celebrate which indeed was very kind of them.  The food in the lounge and the breakfast spread is top notch and best part of the property is the pool"
750,There‚Äôs nothing about this hotel I would complain. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast is marvellous. So many options and food is incredibly tasty. The rooms are big and comfortable. The outside space of this hotel is also great. Good size pool with a nice bar next to it. Staffs all around the hotel are incredibly nice. The gym is also very good size. I certainly recommend for couples or friends!
751,"Coming from a country renowned in the world for its hospitality, my wife and myself were pleasantly surprised to experience the WOW effect at Lotus Cafe.   Food variety (local Indian food to continental breakfast) is awesome and all staff are very dedicated and caring.  Special mention goes to:  1. Chef Binu who, despite the hectic breakfast schedule, took time, every single day, to introduce and explain the different local dishes to us. We could feel his passion and that passion was communicated to us on a daily basis. Although young, he already possesses a very high standard and tremendous culinary knowledge. We were so privileged to get his personalised attention during our stay.  2. Anikhet masters the skills of customer service and dedication. He always preempts what the"
752,The hotel room was very well decorated with Orchids.. including a complimentary cake since we had informed the hotel about the special occasion.  The colour combination and decor of the room is just classy and pleasing enough. I was staying for 3 nights and all the 3 days the breakfast was amazing however the spread for dinner was average.
753,"JW one of the best place in our list . Me and my husband loved it. Gurvinder was a cherry üçí on the cake I should say. Best service from this man. Really liked the way of approaching and finding out the best way to deal with Customers. Thanks to the JW Marriott for the best day and best service.  Regards, Niki Bhatia"
754,"Kunal, Joseph, Sandip (gym) and Rahul  Had an awesome time with you guys and your team members Chef Rahul, Chef Divyanshi, Stewart Alex Looking forward to many more Marriott experiences like this ahead"
755,"JW Marriott is situated on the beach of Juhu. Beach view rooms are available in this property. Being in Juhu, this property is preferred by Bollywood stars. You will see lot of celebrities in the hotel lobby. Property is little old but well maintained. Swimming pool is good in size and regularly cleaned. Restaurant is one of the best in Mumbai with lots of food options across globe. Hotel tariff is high as most of the time it is over booked. We waited 3 hours for checkin. Hotel staff is hardly bothered for non celebrity guests and doesn‚Äôt provide the quality information.  This is good place to stay in Juhu but you have to compromise on hospitality, if you are not a celebrity."
756,"This is the only hotel we'll stay at when visiting family Juhu. We come from US and this is such an accommodating property. English spoken by most, clean, wonderful Spa area and safe feeling. We travel with a toddler and the hotel staff couldn't be nicer. My only reason or not giving 5 stars this time is, our floor hallway was being stripped and painted. Since we had a baby with us I feel they could have given us another floor without fumes, etc. After bringing to hotels attention we did get another room, but this could have been avoided since we booked early and stayed a full week."
757,"This is my 2nd visit to Marriott after exactly a year. And the hotel never failed to make me feel awesome. We had a great stay with Marriott Juhu. Thankyou so much for all the hospitality given to us. For us Marriott is home away from home. My special thanks to Vania, Swati (lounge), Kunal (lounge), Divyanshi (chef lounge) and Sheroo (cleaning guy) and all the other staffs who have always tried their best in making our stay comfortable. Hope to be back soon."
758,"Overall great hotel. Would come back. Great location for me since I am from Vile Parle.   However , it is difficult to get around specially if you want to go to South Mumbai. Hotel staff overall is very good . I want to recognize Mr Alok Verma from Saffron. Not only he is great cheff but went out of his way to feed us even after his restaurant was closed. He saw us hungry and offered us the best meal we ate in last two weeks. Exceptional man and amazing cheff. Only in India we see this kind of gesture.   Rooms are small but comfortable. I had to change my room three times since there was lot of construction going on and was not satisfied initially.   Front desk people are not experienced. They are too young and keep nodding. Their supervisor keeps walking around without any"
759,We stayed at J W Marriot from 4th june to 24th June and had a wonderful experience there. I would always prefer staying at Marriott Juhu in future whenever i am in Mumbai. I want to personally thank  Dattatraya sonawane Vaibhav sontakke Aniket jadhav Binu Mathew Sunil gaikwad for their special care to make our long stay extremely pleasant and memorable.   Thanks  Manisha
760,Stayed for a week on business and I found the hotel nice and the staff helpful.   The location on the super dirty and polluted beach was concerning if you care about the environment.   It seems weird to look out on a super polluted sea and be fenced off from the beach.    Beware over an hour away from Old Bombay by cab so would advise to stay here only if you need to be close to the airport.   The staff are very helpful.
761,"Stayed there twice and they never have your details about your preferences, loyalty number etc. Both times they didn‚Äôt get the lounge access on my key card.  Never had issues with any other JWM whether the Sahar property or abroad. The check in staff is so slow."
762,"As a loyal Jw Marriott customer, I always look forward to explore more and Marriott  never stops to amaze me. Every stay is a new experience. It was my first stay in jw Marriott juhu, mumbai. This is one of the luxuries  hotel in mumbai. I enjoyed the mouth watering buffet.property is splendid and sexy. Specially pool side is outstanding. View of beach from rooms are breathtaking. Staff is cooperative and friendly. Full equipped gyms for bodybuilders. In nutshell, satisfied business stay and I‚Äôll say, everyone and family will love the hotel. A must place to stay to experience the fresh breath of mumbai.  Thanks to Marriott  for awesome service as always."
763,"Worth a visit.  Amazing hospitality by staff . Special thanks to prabhakar, Sumeet, Balkrishna. You all had been truely amazing. Food worth the money. Ambience is like an international restaurant. We had white sauce pasta which was truely chef‚Äôs masterpiece. And pizza was also fab. Overall food is good. Must visit atleast one time."
764,"Stayed in this beautiful property and from check in to our departure everything was flawless. The buffet spread had a lot of Indian options for breakfast which we really enjoyed,The staff at the reception and coffee shop are very hospitable,This is added in my list of favourite luxury  hotel in India."
765,"My husband & I decided to drop by to have a quick bite & ordered for a club sandwich & pizza... I had'nt visited JW Juhu for a long time however I was amazed to still experience warm hospitality apart from the great ambience. Food quality was excellent. My husband whispered to a staff that we were celebrating my birthday & they were kind enough to suprise me with my favorite pastry.... Made me feel special...üòä Thank you Mayuri, Sagar, Nikhil. Keep up the great worküòäüëçüèºüòä Keep smiling....Stay blessedüòá"
766,"My wife and myself spent 3 nights, 4 days at the JW Marriott, Juhu from the 22nd of June to the 25th June, 2018.  We stayed at the Executive Juhu Beach Suite 286.    Our stay was mediocre compared to our earlier ones.  Perhaps, we are tiring of the place, which frankly has deteriorated.    Bad, arrogant service from front office staff named Ameya.  Great service from the following :  Lounge :  Joseph, Kunal and Priyesh. Lotus Cafe :  Aniket    Saffron :  Avinash    Reception :  Vanya and Saif.    The food in the restaurants seems to have fallen in standard.  The band and the sound system at the Lotus Cafe is pathetic.  Mezzo Mezzo just does not seem to change its menu.  Dashanzi is highly over-rated.  The music there sucks big time.  Saffron serves mutton with a lot of fat and"
767,"Stayed here during a business visit and I must say its one of the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Located right at juhu beach and close to some of the happening happening places in Juhu, this is an excellent hotel that doesn‚Äôt disappoint when it comes to location, food, views, comfort and services. There is a large lobby and staff efficiency ensures that check-in is quick.   Considering the Mumbai traffic, one has to decide the location of stay upfront. So if Juhu and nearby areas suit you then its one of the best places to stay.    There breakfast spread leaves nothing to complain and the food was extremely good. The hotel also has access to the beach - but Juhu beach is generally too crowded.  The hotel offers room service and the same was very prompt. Overall, the whole"
768,"I stayed at the JW Mariott Juhu for a week recently with my family. We had booked 2 rooms. The chauffer drive from the airport to the hotel was pleasant and check-in was quick and painless too and within a few minutes of arrival, we were off to our rooms. The service and amenities were excellent, as expected from a hotel of this caliber with well-maintained rooms and facilities.   During our stay, we did have an issue with one of the restaurants. However, Mr. Paoscal at reception was quick to put us in touch with Mr. O‚ÄôNeal, the restaurants operations manager. He listened to our concerns, and thoroughly understood the problem. Then, he took it upon himself to remedy the situation. He went above and beyond his line of duty to not only ensure we were fed but the rest of the"
769,"As always, we have a great time staying at JW Marriott Juhu. Thankyou so much for all the hospitality given to us. For us Marriott is home away from home. My special thanks to all the staffs who have always tried their best in making our stay comfortable.  Hope we can be back soon"
770,"Our third stay at this beautiful hotel - this time as a family.  A hotel run by an awesome team and the attention to detail on every request is amazing! The 4th floor exec lounge team, the concierge team ..all were brilliant!   Our child was injured being clumsy and the care and assistance provided was just amazing.  Breakfast at the Lotus Cafe is brilliant with an awesome team that make us very welcome. A special thanks to the management and especially Balkrishna, Shivam and Rohit - exceptional service.  A small let down at the Saffron for us as we went in with high expectations and we did not feel the meal was as expected.  Overall, the most amazing investment in their people....a Jewel of the Marriotts!"
771,Amazing experience at lotus cafe.Varities of food options and large buffet spread. You have options to choose food from North to South and East to West of India and varieties of continental breakfast.  Binu in Lotus cafe is highly customer focused.
772,"in all the years of my travels for both personal and  professional I have never seen such a profound team of professionals at the JW. As I explained earlier my husband, children and I have been avid Four Seasons travelers and after the experience at JW Marriott Juhu I have such a respect and wonderful taste for your hotel and staff.   The 4th floor lounge has a FABULOUS team of individuals that are both attentive and passionate at what they do. It is such a refreshing breath of air to see and experience this. Diviyanshi is one of the best chiefs I have come across!! She was beyond attentive and sweet with my daughters always making sure they were taken well care of and were in good hands for eating!!! Vijay the 4th floor lounge manager made sure my husband and I were taken well"
773,"Just had some of chef Binu Mathews great food!  So many local Indian dishes to sample. I love to try everything and then ask Chef Mathew for some pointers so I can attempt to make some of the dishes back at home in Buffalo New York, but of course never as good as his!  Thanks to all at the hotel, Sam"
774,"it's always a pleasure to go back to marriott. it is one of those hotels where you would like to transfer to live. beautiful rooms. Delicious food and impeccable service, especially Larsen very kind and friendly."
775,"Recently visited the Lotus Cafe and it was a surprisingly excellent beyond my expectations.the cafe did have some waiting however the person incharge Mr Sandeep Singh made us very comfortable and got me a table soon ,i was surprised by the lavish spread which had everything that one could imagine and even beyond.excellet choice of salads ,chaat ,and meats .Mr singh also suggested a few of his personal favourites and they were really an awesome recommendation. I would personally commend his efforts and that of his team and the chefs present for making my lunch a memorable experience. Would certainly be coming back for a lot more of these visits.Mr singh is certainly an asset for your organisation.Thank you and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sandy Wheeler"
776,"Lunch buffet at the Lotus Cafe of JW Marriott. I was amazed with wide spread of delicacies. Cuisine included North Indian, Chat counter, Continental, live pasta+pizza counter, dimsums, Shushi and more. I was truly impressed with the desserts spread as well. Go with lot of appetite to do justice."
777,The hotel is well located. The staff is very helpful. Had issues with check in but overall good experience. The Indian resturant and coffee shop has room to improve taste of food and variety. Spa is very nice and service is excellent.
778,"I travel a huge amount with work, and in the last 2 months have stayed in hotels in Boston, NY, Washington, Paris, Basel, Copenhagen, Miami, Florida and Milan. I have stayed in Mumbai many times before, but this is my first time at the JW Marriott. I have to say I have been simply outstanded by the staff here. Rohit who bought me green tea last night when I was feeling unwell, to Swati in the club lounge who has gone out of her way to be kind and thoughtful to me as a guest staying here. The room service team have been wonderful too. The level of customer service here is the best I have ever experienced in any hotel in the world, ever.  Well done JW team, you are truly standing out from the crowd and offering something wonderful with your garcious personalities and real care for"
779,Stayed during a business conference.. arrangements we're superb.. best location right on juhu beach in Mumbai..close to airport and main business hub BKC.. what else you ask for when on a business tour
780,JW is Redefining hospitality..!!! Loved being there. Gurvinder deserves a special mention. During breakfast do look out for him. Attention to detail by the custodian of the restaurant is appreciative. Great spread  great rooms. All in all five stars.
781,"The hotel is beautifully built . a very pretty property .Had a wonderful stay , the staff was very hospitable.The Best Part of the stay were Bal Krishna and Akshay Kadam at lotus cafe. They were very courteous.They took great care of us and were really amazing. We‚Äôll surely visit again because of their excellent service.We felt like a family and we‚Äôll recommend this hotel to everyone . The breakfast was really good.Amazing Stay Thanks To Akshay and Balkrishna. The coaches at the poolside and housekeeping staff is really good too."
782,"While I've traveled through Mumbai often, this was first visit into Mumbai to stay. Being a Marriott rewards member, I selected this property, though was a little apprehensive after my last experience at Chennai. Needless to say, I was not disappointed - this property lived up to the Brand Marriott is known for. Excellent service, great staff, and great food (both at breakfast and in the Executive Lounge). I must say the quality and taste of food at the breakfast buffet was significantly better than other properties in the APJ region (with the exception of Seminyak Bali, which matched),  with the staff going out of the way to support a customer preference. For example, I decided to have a hard boiled masala tea (I hate the dip types) after I finished my breakfast and my table"
783,"Have you ever ordered naan, and had something delivered to you 35 minutes later that resembled a slightly-refrigerated used handkerchief that someone had just blown their nose in?   Have you then found yourself scorned by a rude, entitled member of the wait staff for the sheer temerity of raising your voice in complaint?   For experiences like these, visit the Lotus at JW Marriott Juhu. If you have slightly more self-respect, Mumbai has superior eateries and hotels on just about every street. JW Marriott seems to think they can coast along on a poorly-deserved global brand name and treat their customers, particularly Indian ones, like dirt without facing any consequences."
784,"Never go to this place, bigots-this people, serves you on the basis of your religion. No safety, in bath tubs you can get drown. They frisk you if you are a dalit. Black people are also treated badly. Don't go even if all the other hotels are fully booked."
785,When u want to feel pampered and cared for .......a home away from home!!!!!And staff like Mr. Sandeep makes the experience even more gratifying....to create memories with your loved ones JW MARIOTT is the best choice!
786,"This was my one of the best experience till date as hospitality and staff humbleness was out of my expectations. We were surprised by the special efforts made by Rahul at lotus caf√© and superb work Sandeep Singh and his team, I am truly honoured by the great hospitality and will recommend others to stay at property. Kudos to team."
787,"Very nice hotel and awesome food too. Located at a very beautiful location. For business customers there has to be little more focus on customers. Leisure travellers can accommodate with delays , however it can become challenging for business customers. Please have extra focus on the quick services for house keeping or room service."
788,Was here for two nights stay and the hotel made  it a memorable one. Breakfast  ...room aminities were superb ... Italian restaurant food were also impressive .. special thanks to Ankul and Hostess at the reception who made me comfortable during the busy checkout timings.For my upcoming trips to Mumbai ....I don't have any other option than Juhu Marriott ...  BR  Jithendra
789,"The service was its usual best. Ate 3 times at the Blue Cafe, great buffet for breakfast and dinner. A colleague made me try the chaat, delicious. Special mention to Ashkay who was specially attentive at breakfast."
790,Good comfortable rooms in a great central location of Mumbai to get around. The Staff were too impersonal except for the door men. The food was Bad in all the restaurants. Won‚Äôt be going back there again.
791,"This was my first visit to Mumbai, I was visiting from London with my family as part of a holiday as well as celebrate my birthday whilst out there.  We visited Dashanzi for some casual drinks on the first night we landed in Mumbai, we was so amazed with the service that we decided to visit the restaurant many more times after. The staff, ambiance and food were top quality. For my birthday we decided to celebrate at the restaurant, the kind of service we received was out of the world. Me and my family were so blown away, the staff  even went as far as arranging a cake and a bottle of champagne to celebrate with us. We felt so humbled by this. I am writing this review to say a massive thank you to all the staff members at Dashanzi so being so awesome and hospitable. We really"
792,Rooms were spacious and luxurious. Staff was very polite and helpful. Everyone was welcoming and the stay was very comfortable. Felt at home and the amenities were great! Gym and spa were superb and the entire experience was wonderful.

795,"1. Excellent property , good location , Beutifully landscaped , spacious and Grand. 2. Very courteous staff at Reception, Housekeeping, In room Dining, at Restaurants Lotus and Saffron. 3. Mr. Aniket Jadhav at Lotus restaurant very cooperative and courteous. Looked after us very well. 4. Food quality and taste at Saffron excellent. 5. Breakfast at Lotus very good.  6. Ocean View Room superb."
796,"very close to airport, excellent rooms, too good breakfast only complaint is it is too expensive. staff are friendly. evening traffic is horrible so avoid going out in the evening or coming back around 6-7Pm."
797,"When it had first started, this hotel was amazing... and then somewhere in the middle, it just wasn't a place I looked forward to visiting. But I was pleasantly surprised at how great and amazing everything was again... there's an overall change - rooms, service and more than anything, the food. Absolutely fantastic.  I have to give a special mention - the bathrobe and slippers in the room are the best ones yet, that I have used. Absolutely loved them!  Am really looking forward to my next visit! :)"
798,"My family and I have stayed at JW Marriott Juhu many times and have always recieved incredible service. The staff always go above and beyond their duties to ensure our needs are met and even exceeded.  At check in we are always greeted warmly by Chewang and Akarsha, who are both polite, professional and friendly. After a 9 hour flight, it's just the welcome we need! We always book the executive lounge and that will never change. The number of times we have stayed at this hotel, the executive lounge staff have become family. We receive the warmest welcomes and the staff always seem delighted to have us. Swati, Larsen, Pritesh and Vijay are assets to the executive lounge and to the hotel. They exceeded all expectations and continue to impress us with their service and friendly"
799,Visited this hotel for dinner and had an amazing experience. Wonderful ambience wonderful food and most importantly the best staff. Starting from the main entrance till the restaurant everyone were amazing. Would surely recommend this place to everyone. Cheers to the people who make this hotel wonderful.
800,I have been staying here for almost last ten years whenever I travel to Mumbai and must say I almost feel like home. The reason for writing this review is that they need to address some issues to get the fifth star.  - They need to know their regulars. Even after staying around 6 times a year for last 10 years no one recognizes me still..  - They breakfast spread is probably the best in the world but service is just about ok. Some of the staff are really well trained and courteous but some seem so non interested that you dont feel like eating.  - This probably is my biggest issue. They serve the worst cutting Chai. I have been complaining  them for more than one year but no one seem to bother. One of the fnest Mumbai business hotel can not afford to serve bad Masala tea.  There
801,"Visited for lunch and found that the Coffee shop had a very limited menu so that no actual cooking was required. Also the tables are old and need to be replaced or to be cleaned properly. My table was wobbling and was annoying to eat at.   The ambiance of the coffee shop does not match what the rest of the Hotel reflects. Its the JW Marriott so make your coffee shop reflect that .  The Panini i had was good, the Salmon Bagel was excellent though i;d have preferred it with sundried red peppers but the server said they didn't have those and offered regular yellow peppers in it. The quinoa salad was a disaster and the server took it back immediately.   Service is a little slow but the staff is polite and attentive."
802,It's really a heaven not just a Hotel. I recently visited Mumbai and stayed in this Hotel with family. I got surprised to see such a heavenly and most beautiful Hotel. They have plenty of accessories to offer you. It's better than even several International Hotels.
803,"Four years ago we stayed at the Taj Palace and it was magical, wonderful, the perfect stay.  So when looking to return to Mumbai I truly did not feel anywhere could better it.  However we were recommended this hotel, and since our stay can see why it is so well remembered.   The website pics are rubbish ‚Äì ignore them.  The actual hotel is wonderful and a stunning location.   Our arrival and pick up form the airport was flawless, no check in just whisked off to our room.  The perfect start.  The executive lounge affords the perfect view over the pool and beach, and all of the staff in there were fantastic.  But the manager and Tanvi Tanver especially deserve an extra special mention.  Tanvi made sure our favourite sparkling wine was kept super chilled for us, supplied us with"
804,"Arrived at the hotel around 9am. Had reservations for 3 rooms and front office staff were generous to allow all 3 rooms early check-in. Check-in was quick and hassle free. Welcome with chilled watermelon juice for 6 weary travellers was a welcomed relief. Hotel ambience was great but the rooms were surprisingly smaller than some other 5 star hotels we stayed in. Breakfast was good with a wide selection of food. Service was 7 star. Dattaraya and all the support staff (to name a few - Satiah,Amit, Aman and Avinash) gave us nothing short of a royal service. They were only too eager to cater to any of our specific requests. Location was excellent for shopping in near by Santa Cruz. We were allowed a late check-out and the Hotel Transfer to the airport in the Range Rover and Audi"
805,"This is  good hotel dont get me wrong. But the expectations built up by the gorgeous lobby, the inevitable sighting of celebrities,( you will see at least 10 daily) come crashing down when you see the rooms. Too small for the price. I feel the game has moved on, Hotels like St Regis, Lands end are Next level at the same price.  The food at all the restaurants was very good, especially the delightfull cafe.  Overall a good stay despite the room size, but would not stay here again."
806,I stayed at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu recently and had a super time. The best thing about this hotel is it's location with gorgeous views of the sea and i felt so relaxed and at peace just looking out of my suite. i spent a lot of time at the Quan Spa as well and i must admit it is one of the best spas i have ever been too especially spa therapist Ethel is amazingly efficient and i went off to sleep during the massage. Executive Chef Vishal Atreya was very friendly and helpful and i enjoyed my time in all the outlets. BBC is just the perfect place for a cup of tea or an ice cream. General Manager Sharad Puri has an efficient team in place and ensures all guests are very well looked after. Worth several visits !
807,"If you are in Mumbai, you must stay at Juhu or in Bandra.  This property will feature in my top 5 options because of the location.  Juhu is full of action and has the perfect sea view, a lovely beach and yet you are so centrally located.  Value for money.  Elaborate breakfast and some excellent restaurants in the hotel.  Mezzo Mezzo and Saffron are my favorite ones."
808,"Always been a 10 on 10 experience. A few mentions like Miss Priyanka at front desk, A very humble and admiring lady, deserves all appreciations for solving and understanding my queries swiftly. Mr. Prathamesh at Bombay baking company is one person I look out for service always, always smiling n humble. prabhakar at lotus cafe is a gem of a person. These ppl wud surely take Marriott juhu to new heights.  Jw rocks. Will be there again soon."
809,We had an amazing stay at The Marriott Hotel in Juhu. The hotel is spotless with great facilities. The breakfast choice is fantastic with a wide choice of south indian to english varieties.  We were provided with a suite with breathtaking views over Juhu beach. The room was very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. All of the staff are very friendly and work hard to ensure everyone has a wonderful time at the hotel. A special thanks to Mr Vikas Arora for accomodating our needs and ensuring that we had a pleasant stay. It is much appreciated. We will definitely be visiting the hotel again soon!
810,"Stay at hotel was amazing. Hospitality towards the guest by JW Marriot was excellent. Enjoyed the stay at hotel. I liked all the services within the hotel. Restaurant served good food giving the essence of Indian food and specially the local Mumbai food with Paav Bhaaji, Pani Puri etc. In room dining service was little poor as food served in a way that made it cold."
811,"JW Juhu stands out as a classic, evergreen and truly magnificent and what makes it so is its people and scenic location. Hospitality at its best and truly world class. All the front office staff are truly wonderful and always smiling.  Executive Lounge is mostly busy but the staff there makes you feel comfortable and willing to do that extra bit for you. It was good to meet Ivan, and Priyesh after long. They have always been very kind and have looked after me really well !  Alex, Larson, Ajay, Vijay and Swati all are doing a great job in the executive lounge.   The gulab jamun I had the other day was simply awesome and I think they must share the recipe with other Marriott's as well as gulab jamun in particular is never really good at the hotels.  JW Juhu has a nice pool too and"
812,"From the wonderful welcome from Robert and his colleagues at the front desk and Elroy in the restaurant the service is warm, friendly and efficient. The buffet embraces many cuisines of the world with an Indian twist as well as authentic national dishes and all presented to an exceptionally high standard. The hotel is furnished to a luxurious contemporary style and spotlessly clean."
813,"Have spent so much of my life in Mumbai yet it was ironical I spent 2 nights at the Marriott when I have moved to Nairobi. Had been here for our company - Glenmark's annual HR offsite between 23-25th April. The entire conferencing facility was better and more spacious than our previous experience at Taj lands end. Rooms were very good and I had a sea view. The only weird thing about the room was that the bathrooms were transparent so if I had to share my room with someone (which I did not), then it would have been a bit weird or maybe I missed something. Food quality was good and the whole ambience was nice. The breakfast was not as good though and needs some upgradation right from the menu to the chefs who cook at the omelette station. It is definitely expensive so not everyone"
814,"I am staying there for the third time .The hotel is near the airport and situated beside the beach at Juhu.The check in was smooth and the staff friendly.We were there for our company's conference-UTI AMC STRATEGY MEET.The buffet dinner and breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and the spread was amazing .The banquet hall where are our meeting was quiet big to accomodate 200 persons comfortably.The lobby is big and beautiful.Enjoyed my stay. Last year when I stayed ,I left my blazer inside the wardrove.On taking up the matter by mail I received the same by courier."
815,"We recently stayed at this gorgeous hotel for a few days prior to embarking on a cruise from Mumbai. The staff was superior! We were immediately greeted with ‚ÄúNameste‚Äù which was the case throughout our stay from management to housekeeping. The concierge lounge offered an excellent variety of food & beverage and the wait staff was professional and soo very accommodating & gracious. Wonderful, above & beyond service! The front desk reception & concierge were very professional & helpful with arranging transportation & sightseeing activities for us! The lobby was large & beautiful with a  huge glass window offering a gorgeous view of the pool and impeccable grounds, which met with the ocean, breathtaking! The lobby was refreshed daily with brilliant fresh flowers & new"
816,We stayed here for 3 nights and most of the time We were out of the hotel but entire staff was very friendly and helpful. We had and amazing room and liked the breakfast a lot. I thank to Concierge for making my life easy in Mumbai with there suggestion and they are amazing. Keep up the good work Luis and Abhishek and thank you for your help.   Review will not b completed wihtouse mention of Housekeeping and front desk. Sorry forgot the name of th guy who took our check in but he was very friendly and liked talking to him during the stay. Our housekeeper Sonali was outstanding. Every time we come back from outside our room was clean but she goes extra mile and keep the room as per our preference only. What a amazing service and I have learn a lot from it.  Keep up the good work
817,"Over the last 20 years or more, in spite of newer hotels, JW Marriott Juhu has been our choice of hotel while in Mumbai and my husband and I have often stayed here, alone, together or with our family.  Over this time, the quality of service has usually been excellent and on those occasions where it has fallen short, members of the Management team have taken effective steps to rectify the situation.   I recently stayed here from 6-8 March and again from 15-18 March. On the latter occasion, Vini Bachani went the extra mile to fix some issues regarding my room during my first stay.  This made all the difference to my experience of being at this hotel and I really appreciate Vini‚Äôs professionalism and willingness to make customer experience a priority.   A big thanks to Noor‚Äîthe"
818,"We loved staying at this hotel. The pool is fantastic and clean. Ambiance is fantastic! Be prepared for security checks driving in and also entering into the hotel.  We had access to the concierge lounge and the breakfast buffet is superb! The service was very professional. After shopping through several cities in India I wish I would have purchased more in the gift shop there. The prices were good or at least comparable. There is a bakery in the lobby area that has sandwiches, baked goods and breads. They also had small gift items like teas, canned cookies etc. that was convenient for me to purchase to take as a house warming gift when we were visiting people's homes. I surely appreciated that. There is also a small book store attached to the bakery. We were advised to not swim"
819,"so I planned a surprise stay for my husbands birthday and the hotel was gracious enough to let my plan be successful we had a wonderful time , Ameya at the front desk was so helpful and sweet Sania from Guest relations was ever so kind and polite and she even helped  me pick and choose a cake from the BBC located at the hotel. the room was amazing but the pool took the cake.... it was to die for. we later celebrated his bday at Mezzo Mezzo and the meal was delightful . Chef Vinod even greeted us at our table and we were very happy and humbled  to meet him... the pizza and burrata salad was excellent  , Shreyas the wait staff from  the restaurant was cheerful and very sweet  and immpeccable with his service  and the whole bday dinner experience   was an unforgettable one !. all"
820,"The hotel is awesome. The facilities and amenities are great. The cleaning staff have impeccable respect and are ever willing to help! But I had a major problem with the concierge which left me distrustful of the ‚Äúso called‚Äù front desk staff. We arrived on Friday and on Saturday night asked the concierge to recommend a Mumbai night tour of a few pubs and clubs.  I don‚Äôt want to mention any names but we were chatting to the ‚Äútour operator‚Äù on WhatsApp with the expectation that the same guy (who could speak English) would conduct the tour (we were paying for a private 4 hour tour) - from 8.30 to 9, then at 9.20 we received a cab driver(quite oldish) who couldn‚Äôt speak English. Anyways it wasn‚Äôt his problem. My issue is that the concierge made this connection and I cannot believe"
821,This hotel has the best location as you can enjoy juhu beach at it's back and good food in the front. Food with in hotel is also good. Rooms are not too spacious but spacious premium rooms are also available.
822,Wonderful stay at the JW Marriott. This hotel is on par with or second only to the Taj in terms of Luxury and Location. This hotel is frequently visited by various Bollywood stars who live nearby and use the Hotel bar and restaurants. Staff were helpful and food was amazing. We met a film star every hour whilst staying here and location is perfect to do some exploring and shopping in Juhu/Santa Cruz. Breakfast choice is huge and based in the amazing and huge lower lobby which faces the swimming pool area and is often lit up by live musicians. Also would like to make a special mention to Alok Verma the Exec Sous Chef and Jazib Husain the Restaurant Manager who made our stay very special and also cooked us a very personal evening dinner !
823,"Everything from check in to room service to housekeeping and check out is incredibly slow. In the time I stayed at this property, i didnt manage to see any request Serviced in under 30 min - even asking for tea Bags to be delivered to the room.  Checkout is slow, people unapologetic about long wait times and staff doesn‚Äôt seem to have a clue on room availability, late checkout etc. It was a comfortable stay, but I‚Äôm disappointed with the staff and service levels. Not sure if I‚Äôll return here."
824,"One of the best hotels in India. Awesome rooms with a beach view,swimming pool to die for,lotus cafe,dashanzi and 2 other restaurants which provide awesome food. Has all the amenities like sauna jacuzzi spa etc."
825,"We had a wonderful stay at the JW Marriott, Juhu on 26 April 2018. The service was exceptional beginning with Amen and other staff at the front desk to Crosby, Ashish and other staff at the Lotus Cafe (service was completely different from when we had last visited in January). Truly Five Star rooms and service. We would surely come back again Thank you"
826,"With it‚Äôs seafront location in Juhu, this remains one of my most favourite hotels. Staff members are always welcoming, very attentive and quick to respond to my requests. The hotel very kindly gave us one upgrade to a suite so that we (Four friends) could share the lounge through interconnecting doors. We had sea views and Business lounge access. Our three night stay was a real pleasure. Rooms had been well maintained...windows had been cleaned on the outside. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was exceptional as usual, although it would have been nice to see some mangoes offered as the season had begun. The pool area was very clean and a relaxing place to be in the early evening. The business lounge provided a good, quiet space to talk with friends. I look forward to my next"
827,"Let me start by saying that this is a beautiful resort and I had a very pleasant experience.  Checked in late due to flight delay for a one night stay and as a Marriott Gold I was upgraded to a very large suite. The pool is beautiful and the Spa and the staff are excellent.   So why not 5 stars?  I just felt at times the staff were not as attentive as other places I have stayed. At the pool for example there is a small bar to order food and soft drinks.  Throughout the day there were 3-4 staff members huddled around the bar but at no time did they walk around to see if guests wanted anything and so ended up having to go up to order, on second occasion having to wait a bit for the staff to finish talking before they acknowledged me. Similar experience in the 4th floor lounge -"
828,"Actually had a lovely stay - shame it was ruined by the process after   When checking out we told the lady we wanted to pay it rupees, when we got home we realised they had put the transaction through as pounds so used the hotels exchange rate - ended up paying an extra ‚Äò¬£120 - called the hotel so many times, promised this would have been resolved weeks ago.called 5 times today and always promised a call back and just nothing.   They even did this in the spa    This is an illegal transaction and we will now have to take legal action"
829,The hotel is located right on the famous Juhu beach in Mumbai. Most of the rooms have a view of the sea which is nice. The hotel staff are courteous and efficient. The breakfast buffet has a great variety.
830,"Superb experience at the Hotel.  Everything was out of this world  The Lotus Cafe - Excellent.  The Chef Alok Verma was superb and very accommodating with our special meal requirements.   The Restaurant Managers, Kailash and Jazib were superb.  Also a mention for the ever efficient and smiling staff, Elroy, Prabhakar, Sagar J and Sagar S and most pleasing was an intern Imran who was excellent.  Housekeeping - excellent.  Kunal looked and cleaned our room on 2nd floor very well.  Front Office/Reception.  Siddharth, Akshaya and Gaurav very very helpful.  Prior to check in, Vinny was very accommodating and helpful with the information prior to check in.  Anirudh in sales even took time out on the weekend to meet us and make us comfortable.  The whole experience was remarkable and"
831,"This is one of my favorite hotels to stay when I visit India. The staff, location, food - everything is excellent. I would like to recognize a few staff members - Siddharth, Vinny (Front Desk), Alex, Piyush, Ivan (Lounge), Pankaj (Door man), and many more. Lotus and Saffron are my favorite restaurants."
832,"5 star hotel with 5 star price but definitely worth it. Rooms are immaculate, breakfast has a wide array of choice. The hotel is  buzzing 24/7 with movement to either the dance club or for coffee. One can never be bored even if chilling on the lobby. Make sure to visit melting pot and one ten restaurant which are opposite the hotel for finger licking food."
833,We had gone for a weekend stay and took an upgrade room with club lounge facilities. The room was on top floor with excellent pool and sea view. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. The club lounge was the best part of the hotel. The complimentary drinks were served till 9.30 PM with delicious snacks. The breakfast at Lotus Cafe was grand spread. The service was absolutely top class throughout hotel. The stay at JW Marriott was any time much better option than going to crowded Lonavala on a weekend.
834,"What a disappointment the JW Marriot Juhu is ; a long wait at check-in, customers arguing and complaining loudly about the check-in, scruffy lifts, tired room with spots on the bed linen. I went for a swim in the cloudy, not very clean pool and when i asked for a drink, the man behind the counter looked at the clock and said it was past the time for serving! He did'nt offer arranging a simple nimboo soda from the terrible cafe-just indifference all the way through. The staff here are tired and lazy-they cant even smile sincerely and that is so off-putting. That apart, the Marriot needs to gut the place and redo it.  The managment really needs to fix things here, it's sad to see a propert like going to seed."
835,"The best hotel to stay in Mumbai. The staff is absolutely great and they made my stay truly memorable. Fantastic pool area and good variety of restaurants and bars. Excecutive Lounge is a great place to have some appertizers and drinks before dinner. My suite was super spacious with a great sea and pool view. I have been in many hotels in Mumbai, but from now on JW Juhu is my ‚Äùhome‚Äù in Mumbai. See you again in three weeks!"
836,We had a group booking at JW and an offiste meeting at the conference rooms. Service was impeccable. Only disappointment was they had limited menu for our breakfast compared to other resident guests.  The pool place has so many crows around and we didn't feel like using it. Its nothing like the pics they show in website. They also dont allow access to the beach without room number and the door is alwayz locked. So it kinda restricts the movement. Not that they have cleaned the place outside their hotel. Its very dirty compared to the beach side outside novotel. Also the bathrooms in the rooms dont have latches.Maybe this works for couples but its embarassing when you stay with your colleagues. Rooms are quite spacious and elegant.Some have a view of the beach too.
837,"I must say it is  nice hotel. Room with sea view was fabulous. They have multiple swimming pools. For buffet they have lot of varieties  but I find less variation ( in my 4 days stay)  in sweet section. Food was good but I will only say that at the breakfast time they need more persons or more ""efficient "" persons. I will also mention that the gate leading  to beach should remain open till 8 pm. They close it by 7 pm, which is bit early in summer time. Staff is courteous. My best wishes."
838,"Noticed that my 2015 review is still showing, so no need to add, but to say that we revisited JW in March 2018, as we are so pleased with JW. Numerous  new staff, all very professional  and a credit to JW and their management.  Very unfair to mention names, but, Taraka Kubal (Housekeeping Mgt) and Kailash (Lotus) made our stay so memorable. Have commended other staff from lotus, direct to JW management."
839,"my room was a deluxe one. Great amenities and 5 star service by the people. Excellent quality food,with swimmingpool,gymroom and many  other amenities.rooms were really clean as well as the whole area.really want to visit again."
840,"The hotel was excellent, the staff were very courteous, the food was fantastic. The service from Shivam in the Lotus Cafe was excellent, as was the cleanliness of my room each day thanks to Rajesh. Nilesh from the Hotel's airport srvices also ensured that transit from the airport to the hotel went very smoothly."
841,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.  Check-in was very welcoming, Ashay who checked us in was very professional with a subtle personal touch made us look forward to our stay after a stressful flight messed up by Air India. All the services were 5* with a extra bit of personal touch by Shubham from housekeeping, who personally came to check if we were comfortable. The room was good and comfortable, the bed was good except for the mattress topper which we asked to remove (maybe our personal choice) . Breakfast was fantastic with a excellent spread to cater for most tastes. I would have rated this hotel more than 5* for a great service, comfort, ambience, location and very courteous staff.  Thanks Ashay and Shubham for making our stay a memorable one."
842,Senthil Chef in Executive Lounge is a goes out of his way to fulfill your appetite. Staff are very courteous. Juhu Beach is just in courtyard. Comfortable stay. Room service is too good. The Gym is well equipped. Their Coach Amin takes individual care.
843,"SPECTACULAR STAY. A holiday weekend away from home yet felt like home. Vijat from the Executive Lounge earlier from BBC Cafe is a great host. Rahul and Satish at Lotus cafe, Gladwin at BBC Cafe, Champa at Dsanzi, are exceptional at their hospitality. The poolside, the food, the warmth, the courtesy id top class. The entire staff of the hotel takes care of you like you are special. Amen, Chewang, Sarfaraz, at Guest relations are super. Highly recommended for Family, Weddings as well as Business stay."
844,"Though being Marriott member and also we have stayed in Marriott hotels in Bali, the room we got in this hotel was not that spacious. Also , we didnt get sea facing room. Lotus cafe spread of cuisines were ok and compared to other mariot hotels, the food and room service was ok."
845,The food at the hotel was very nice as they have chefs preparing it infront of you with great service from all the staff occasionally you do get the few uptight members of staff the rooms are very small for what they are
846,Truly a hotel that makes you feel so good that you don't want to leave.  An amazing ambiance with some extremely helpful and courteous staff. The food is tasty with good proportions. The breakfast buffet has a wonderful range that spoils you for choice. Great place to stayüëåüëå
847,"Great place, lovely property good people  A home away from home. The location is spot on bang Opp the sea.  The lounge is a great place to relax n well looked by Mr Vijay.  The poolside boys r all great n ever ready to help. The FnB manager I think Mr O Neil runs this place so well that there never is a single guest who would ever be unhappy. A truly people‚Äôs, people man.  We reside at Santacruz n then to check in to stay twice a year, because the property is so relaxing n cool. Thank You folks You r doing A Great Job."
848,Stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip and can't praise this hotel highly enough.  Check in was very smooth and the staff from start to finish were excellent.  I only ate in the hotel bar which was good and not overly expensive. Breakfast was fantastic and the choice was marvellous.   My room was on the 12th floor and I had a lovely view over the pool. It was cleaned daily and the lovely touches at night of the turn down service were greatly appreciated.  I'd love to go back and hopefully I'll get the chance.
849,"The hotel and the staff were absolutely fantastic.  First Phoebe Ralte's (Guest Relations) response to us for a request I had made  for some flowers, after letting her know that we were a newly engaged couple were fabulous.  She welcomed my fiance with a vase full of beautiful flowers.  We were given a beautiful room overlooking the pools and the Arabian Sea.  Phoebe's service reminded me of why I continue to stay with Marriott hotels as well as SPG.  She represents everything Marriott tries to achieve. We ate at the Dashanzi restaurant and had a wonderful meal.  The food was excellent and the staff even better.  We could not have asked for better service.  It was a time when dinner and dessert lasted for a very long time and it still seemed a short time. We spent some time time"
850,"Had a wonderful stay in Mumbai despite the heat. The Marriott provides excellent service despite some inconsistent the most disappointing is the check in front desk. Good room, clean, luxurious and very comfortable. Love the food n service at the BBC. Will definitely stay there again."
851,"I have traveled in more than 30 countries and stayed at the best and most expensive of hotels. I am also a fan of JW Marriott brand, having stayed at their properties in Singapore, Pune, Delhi....etc. However, this Juhu hotel has fared worse than a third-grade hotel. Forget luxury 5 star, they seem to lack basic decency and service. I have paid over Rs 50,000 during the stay for a 2 day stay and have come back with a bad experience.  My family had checked in for a 2 day weekend stay - to celebrate my wife's birthday. Apart from many issues, they couldnt even get a birthday cake right on the occasion. Hotel seems high-handed due to celebrity guests and events and doesnt have the decency to treat hotel guests well.  - I had spoken to the duty manager asking for the birthday cake"
852,"I sat in the bar to have a drink here while my husband met a friend. The bartender Herbert was so kind and friendly. I didn‚Äôt like a wine he brought out for me so he allowed me to taste various wines so as to be able to decide what I wanted. He chatted to me about why I was visiting India, and said he liked Gareth Bale, when I told him I was from Wales. Beautiful place."
853,Great room..great location excellent service..great executive lounge staff ...again well beyond our expectations..will definitely go over and over again..Jw Marriot always has the best service and staff..Breakfast to die for..
854,"Located on Juhu beach, this JW Marriott has your safety and security in mind. Although it is a compound, it feels like a resort. The breakfast and lunch buffet are very impressive. The staff is always courteous and there is every amenity a business or leisure traveler could desire. The pool area is luxurious. While there are many things to do in Mumbai, I usually prefer to enjoy the amenities on the property."
855,"A characteristic good welcome and an especially supportive engaged concierge desk.  The height of the desk at this and the check in area is far too high and is an unfortunate barrier to communication.  I ate breakfast at the hotel on the large ground floor area, that has a mezzanine with live music. This facility is fine if you have a leisurely timetable but not fast enough for early morning at speed (prior to business) use. The range of breakfast foods is impressive, and the area is generally sufficiently well manned though it does have some ‚Äòcrunch times‚Äô that it acknowledges.  The first floor snack bar area is excellent, fast , efficient and with delicious freshly prepared items from BBC (Bombay Catering Company) . It has seating and a few shops, one of which is a good"
856,"Visited last week for a day with family. Had booked a weekend package with some amenities and dinner and breakfast. The reception had no clue of my package , I had to call up and ask for the package includes to be delivered to my room. They had no clue what the package contained. Then someone checked it out and sent after some time.   The buffet dinner, I had to wait ten minutes for a table. People were waiting for soup bowls to be provided. I moved to the next counter. There were very few servers and it was a chaos.   The room was small compared to other hotels of similar category. No bath tub. The property is not that big.  Overall it was not value for money."
857,"During our stay at an impeccable hotel in Mumbai, we received excellent service and friendly staff who were able to assist us with any concerns and needs. The food was up to a high standard and catered for Non Veg and Veg too. For people who have applied for an executive lounge, the service we gained was out of this world and the environment was friendly with appropriate seating for everyone. It was a great experience, recommended for any parties that wish to come, and we will definitely be coming back again."
858,"Well known locally as the JW, this is an established hotel, part of the scene. We first visited 14 years ago and in many ways nothing has changed - familiar but excellent quality, great staff and service. The Lotus Cafe has an enormous range for breakfast but if you prefer a quiet solitude then visit the Club Room or go early. Great views over the Arabian Sea, especially at sunset. Highlight is an early morning stroll on the beach, all cleaned up. The large upgraded bedroom that we had was not well designed, not enough wardrobe space."
859,"The hotel is very clean, modern, has excellent service levels from staff who are also very friendly. It has a great gym and spa. The rooms are spacious and relatively quiet, however, my bed was very worn and no longer flat, rather conked in towards the middle. The bathroom only had a shower, no bath. The breakfast spread is good. The dinner buffet was the same food both nights, some variety would be good. Security is excellent"
860,JW Mariott Juhu is a luxurious and over the past decade has become an icon in Juhu. The exterior gives a royal feel and the interiors of the hotel along with the rooms are neat and clean.  The only downside is that the meals in the hotels may seem overpriced but thats what you pay for a 5 star
861,"Absolutely wonderful and staff always very helpful.  The location is absolutely wonderful and excess to the beach just from the hotel.  Breakfast is just amazing, delicious and out of this world.  Our special thanks to Avinash the food & beverage staff member.  He just could not do enough for us even though they were always very busy.  Also food & beverage managers were excellent.  Even if there was a small problem it would not only be sorted very quickly but also provided something else to compensate for the problem.  Just the day before we were leaving, there was no hot water in the shower.  They got someone to try and it sort it out straightaway and they couldn't repair it straightaway so they provided another room very quickly.  They compensated us for this as well.  Very"
862,"Our third visit this month - and being a Marriott Platinum - we were given Royal treatment from each and every staff member starting from the doormen, the lobby hosts (thanks Shabaz) to the lounge staff (Evan, Kumar, Yvuka, Ankit - forgive me for not naming the rest) made each of our stays memorable. The hotel was packed on two occasions so we could not be upgraded - but the club rooms were comfortable and all in all very very good. The newly added GST tax makes the nightly rate expensive - but then Mumbai in general is expensive - and if you plan on visiting this city - I would recommend staying at this beach front property"
863,This is a lovely hotel with fairly good customer service.  The staff sometimes don‚Äôt get things right and it can be inconvenient though. An example was the room card not working and the staff messing about at the reception desk with silly questions.   Breakfast is a little inefficient as a process. The supply of orders is slow and haphazard.   The breakfast restaurant staff are very nice. A big mention to Shivnam who was very charming every morning.
864,Many thanks for hosting are friends outing.. this is always a favorite place... cheers... the cold breezy evening by juhu beach adds up to the whole experience.. the coffee and sandwiches at bbc are the.best...
865,Just JW Marriott Juhu is an absolute amazing property this staff is amazing excellent utility eager to to help people nice good nature overall is very fantastic Hotel nice property looking forward to come here again soon
866,"Luxurious n comfortable indeed.. Stayed in the Hotel last week with friends. As we stepped in the room it was just fabulous, Good n helping housekeeping n service staff. Very caring. Took care of all our needs. Food was nice. Very close to Juhu beach.  Great Hospitality. 10/10 guys.. had a wonderful weekend."
867,"JW Marriott Juhu  This Place Is Located In Juhu, Besides V Hotels And Ramada Plaza With a Perfect View Of Juhu Beach.   We Had Taken A Stay Here For One Night Two Days, Which was A Weekend, We Were Aloted At The Third Floor Of the Hotel, Which Was Sea Facing Room.  I Liked The Decor, Room Service, We Were Provided A JBL Speaker, Hair Dryer Etc and Lot More Accessories In The Room."
868,"Extremely luxurious Indeed ..... clear , busy and well maintained hotel on all counts . The F&B seriously ROCKS and one of the finest in Mumbai . Has a terrific fitness centre and well trained Gym instructors for seem professionals indeed .  Never Check Out without having to get to know the units General Manager ..... please do ask for him and discuss on your issues and suggestions to give .... a through gentleman ! Wish to splurge a bit, opt for the hotel‚Äôs SUITES , as they are extremely cosy and very spacious and gives you a splindid view of the sea .  The Executive Lounge is spacious and very well maintained and has good attentive staffs . Any visits or stays in Mumbai , do not miss out on this hotel ."
869,"Year after year we have an amazing stay in JW Marriott Hotel, Juhu,Mumbai. This year was no different.  Starting with-  The Front Desk:  I would like to thank Abhishek, for being very efficient and persevering in trying to help us and actually solving any issues. Akarsha was very warm and friendly too.  Bombay Bakery : The sandwiches are lip smacking there. We were served by Stefan. He stood out for being thoughtful, efficient and proactive. Our daughter wasn't well. He noticed that himself and straightaway got  ice cubes for the injury & honey lemon water tea     Lotus Cafe: The heart of Marriott! The buzz , the service and exceptional quality and variety of food will overwhelm you. Its absolutely the best. Few names that definitely deserve a mention are - Chef Mehta ,who is"
870,"I just want to give a thumbs up to the young man who cleaned our room, he is polite and knows his job he has great customer service! Sunnill keep up the good work! I am sure you are one of the best. Unfortunately the restaurants, lounge and spa and other services lack customer service."
871,"Jw marriott a well known 5 star property in juhu mumbai , yesterday I had a stay in the property ie. 3 rd march I got three rooms which was all with separate beds , we were three couples , and asked for king size or queen size bed , they instantly said no we don‚Äôt have , then we took dinner , in lotus restaurant which was horrible , first they took orders after 15 minutes, then after an hour they got food to eat, which was tasteless, cold rubber like naan , tasteless dal makhani, which was so mouthwatering at some time, then paneer lababdaar which i don‚Äôt no what was than n matter paneer horrible, with veg biryani which was ok but without raita or any thing else.  The service of the hotel has been down graded , we served our food by ourself , nothing was proper as it should"
872,Nice and peaceful easy excess to juhu chapati staff are very polite food is nice surround nice restaurant not far from airport good all round breakfast room are very nice u can enjoy him and swimming pool big lounge nice live Indian classic giater muzic
873,"The hotel is beautiful and the location on the beach is great.  The service is wonderful--very attentive and friendly, the staff will leave you wanting for nothing.  The rooms were a bit on the small size, but clean and well appointed.  Food quality was very good, both at the breakfast buffer and via room service"
874,I have been coming here now for close to 20 years . This hotel badly needs renovation both of rooms but also banquet areas. Also cost cutting shows is service and delivery of hospitality experience . I think they should downgrade from luxury to just normal 5 star .
875,"Stayed at the Juhu Marriott for 2 nights for our Anniversary weekend. We booked a Deluxe Room but the small room, non-functional tv and faulty shower pushed us for a change. Samantha was prompt from guest services and upgraded us to Premier Room. Thanks for the prompt service. The stay from then was a breeze. Great buffet at the Lotus Cafe, enjoyed the room service and pool. The kids pool was nice for our 3yr old daughter. The hotel offers a private entrance to the Juhu Beach - nice walks in the evening during sunset are highly recommended. Special mention to Rahul and Nilesh at the Lotus Cafe for prompt service. Will come back again."
876,"The property leaves you asking for nothing more - lush, expansive, waterfront! I did get the sense, though, that banquets and big weddings are the mainstay and consequently, the individual hotel guest gets a bit short-changed. The hotel lobby seemed to be teeming with the post-effects of a wedding the previous night/day, with stay-over guests all over. I had booked the 'Juhu Beach Suite package' and requested an early check-in. The car (part of the package) was there to receive me, but my room was not ready. And there began the stream of excuses from late check-out of prior guest to room being readied to 'just 10 minutes more'. I was invited to wait in the lounge (again part of package) and waited 2 hours (a good 1 hour over even the stipulated  check-in time) before I could get"
877,I stayed at Marriott in October with my daughter for one week and it was great; I wrote a review as well.  I persuaded my sisters to stay here on our recent stopover in Mumbai as I thought they would be suitably impressed.  However; by the end of my 3 day 2 night stay there; I was embarrassed that I had persuaded them to stay here. The customer service is almost non existent.  My check in took a long time.  We were given a terrible room.  No views and located opposite a service room; my sister could not sleep as there was noise coming from there all night.  The room was very small and it was a tight squeeze for us.  Service at both the lotus caf√© and club lounge were virtually non existent; we had to repeatedly ask for a waiter to take our order or clear the table or to get
878,"This Juhu hotel has been a landmark and has been around for ever They maintain their standards inspite of  continued heavy rush ( as seen by the number of people in the lobby and also having breakfast) Had a wonderful nights stay , very conveniently located , right on the beach, close to the airport ( average 20 min ride), close to shopping either at Lokhandwala or Bandra  Great breakfast, clean well appointed room. Courteous staff"
879,"This property of Marriot has always been my first preference, whenever I think of my stay in Mumbai.  Apart from all the things one should expect from a 5 Star or a hotel of Marriot Group, The team players at this preoperty is the cherry on cake.   I have stayed at this property for multiple times, EVerytime I use to think that  I will write down the name of lovely people I came across, during  my stay the day I will submit a survey or I will review it. Unfortunately the day never came.  Apparently, its here today  And its here for a reason, We usually come across some enthusiastic, dedicated, hard working, keen to help kind of people, when you have to deal with hotels very frequently.  However this time, I met Mr Vikas Arora, whom I found way beyond these normal characteristics"
880,"We checked into the JW Marriott, Mumbai Juhu hotel on Monday 19th February and out on Wednesday 21st February and stayed on room numbers 242 and 244.  We appreciate the excellent services offered by all staff from the security, conceirge, reception etc.    Upon checking in however, the receptionist was abit slow but eventually, all was done.   All the staff were very cordial, helpful and professional.   One of the staff who surely deserve recognition and appreciation is Rupesh at the breakfast table, whom we also met on the 2 days we were there.   He for sure did a fantastic job and made us feel at home.   I also mentioned the same to the manager: Mr. Sachin Padlekar who also appreciated my feedback.  On checking out, Siddhart did a wonderful job.   Few things that need"
881,"It was really a paradise on earth ! Everything was ‚ÄúPERFECT‚Äù  Especially the attention and Good care at breakfast , more specific from ‚Äú Rupesh‚Äù , and always with a big smile!  Also Vania from the reception did a great job ... like all the others I forgot....  We will turn back for this beautiful experience in this amizing India with all those lovely and caring people , Thanks   Best regards, Ellen Van Genechten , Philip , Jules & Charlotte"
882,"Unfortunately because of relatives I could not stay here, but I hosted a party of 9 to Sunday Brunch at Lotus Cafe .   The decor and location are just fabulous!!  I had requested a window side table in my reservation and they came through and how.   We got a long table - by the Window waiting for us at 1:45 PM - could have easily seated more than my Party of 9. Thank You To Vijay Dulgai -   Food was just excellent and I did not have to worry about my guests‚Äô culinary or dietary preferences.  We were all Happy and Satisfied .. and sated by the time lunch was done - and we hung around until 5 as they were prepping the restaurant for Dinner.  The staff was Just Awesome catering to the party from the live stations and unstructured ordering.  Parag the restaurant manager is just"
883,"Totally amazed by the service received. Such humble staff and you can feel the positive energy in this place. In particular Jazib, the restaurant manager went out of his way to provide a vegan option for my fianc√©e which meant a lot. Thanks for making our visit a special one!"
884,"The Juhu Marriott is a fantastic hotel with a beautiful outdoor pool overlooking a peaceful and attractive part of the celebrated Juhu Beach,  There are a number of excellent restaurants and a great coffee shop inside the complex which is kept to a very high standard indeed.  A lovely place to stay and relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city."
885,"My association with this JW Marriott Juhu has been a long one since 2004.  I have had great experiences at your hotel and met professional staff, However Sachin Padlekar‚Äôs (at BBC) professionalism and his ability to get to the bottom of situations quickly exceeded my expectation.  One of the many unforgettable kindness of Sachin‚Äôs happened when I left my phone charger in a cab. I was supposed to make an important international call only from my work phone and it was on its last bar.  I did not know where to get a charger as it was few minutes away from the time of the conference call.  I then asked most of the staff if they can help me borrow a charger from anyone, no one had Samsung Galaxy S8+ charger.  I was very desperate to make that international on time but how?  Sachin"
886,"I was here in Dec 2016- I had a fantastic experience. This time it was not that good to start with, however as soon as they realized with our feed back that we were not happy they soon rectified it straight away.  Manager- Jazib Hussain and waiter Sagar-thank you much for listening to our grievances both my husband and myself really appreciated your help and looking after us both This time we had dinner in one of the restaurant situated in Marriots -Saffron. You must try this restaurant- food is excellent and the head chef- Alok Verma cooked us an excellent meal as it was our Anniversary and made it very memorable -thank you! Would like to thank Tanvi who served us in the executive lounge and was there in the Saffron restaurant  All the staff- thank you so much for making my"
887,"For those considering staying here please have a rethink as they are must better properties that will happily take your money and in return provide you with a premium product and service!!!   Very disappointed and extremely frustrating to be staying here having heard so much hype!!   Will try and catch the GM tomorrow and explain our needs and wants and hopefully we can resolve these issues amicably.   Safe, TV, power points do not work!!! And the duty manager is happy to agree that for just what marriot is a Normal practice here."
888,Great hotel Great hotel. Could not find anything to complain about. Food and service were excellent. Complimentary fresh fruits everyday service is so special. Really enjoyed our stay there and will definitely stay there our next visit to Mumbai.
889,"Great stay at the JW Marriott Juhu.  Dinner at Mezzo mezzo (1 of the 5 restaurants) was nice. The dish I ordered wasn‚Äôt quite as I would have liked, so we mentioned it to the waitress and the chef came out to see us within minutes, we received great service and a free desert. The following morning, there was a very minor mix up with the breakfast table we‚Äôd been seated at, so our waiter Aniket, went over and above to make sure we had a fantastic breakfast - giving us a free cheesecake and bottle of wine (if slightly bizarre for breakfast)! Which was very sweet :) The breakfast options where vast and the fruit was amazing!  Overall, great hotel, slight shame that the beach is cordoned off with barbed wire fences. Great staff and a great room overlooking the beach and pool with a"
890,"I was visiting this place for one of the seminars. I chose to come on Harley Davidson because I thought I wouldn't have to worry about my bike at JW. When I was about to enter the premises. I was stopped by two guards and they asked me to park my motorbike somewhere outside. As it was started raining just before I was at the gates, I requested them to consider this and let me in till the rain stops. I said I will go out and park if needed. But they didn't bother and repeated the same. I also asked them where is the parking lot for two wheelers outside but they said you search it on the roadside. I was so pissed off by this unruly and rude behaviour I chose not to enter and went back. I am surprised how come a hotel like JW Marriott does not have a motorcycle parking lot? Why"
891,"Honestly the service you will get is fine as a upscale hotel, but considering the high price, the facilities were poor, although with a quite well maintenance , all the stuffs are old, and room also quite small, you don't even get a tube for bath(while the price is more than 15000 INRs ) Back to the location, since the juhu beach is so junky , it is not attractive at all."
892,"Best service and choice of food. The Lotus Cafe restaurant staff were courteous, especially, Aniket who ensured that our food needs were met. In fact, all staff, right from housekeeping, reception, concierge, and security staff were very helpful and attentive."
893,I was here for a short visit. Location was fabulous. And the property architecture was one of its kind. Check-in was smooth and hassle free. Avoid checking in late as they have a limited staff at night and luggage took nearly 2 hours and 4 reminders for reaching to room from hotel balcony. The best part of the stay was multi-cuisine breakfast that starts 6:30am. And all the chef make it to perfection. Distance from the international terminal is so amenable that even early morning flight can be taken without much effort of early wake up. In all a pleasant stay. Would definitely recommend
894,"Stayed in January after checking out of another hotel, what a stark difference  between the 2. Staff were very helpful, friendly and professional. Location faced directly on to Juhu beach complete with a great swimming pool on site. Beds were very comfortable, rooms very spacious and clean. we ate at the hotel on 3  occasions, the Flavours of India buffet one evening was delightful, with the staff offering suggestions on what to try first and giving you samples to taste.Lunch and breakfast buffets were both varied with many dishes to select from. Staff, especially the food and beverage and reception staff that we had dealings with are an absolute credit to the hotel.They remind me of why we are Marriott members, should have booked there initially. Only downside is trying to get"
895,"We have stayed at the JW Marriott at Juhu in Mumbai on five different occasions from 2012 to 2015. Every time it was the best experience of a lifetime for us. The staff, I have forgotten some of the names, but ALL of them, without exception were just brilliant. Noting was too much for them. Help was always there when needed.   The breakfast in the morning was the best experience for us. It was a wonderful beginning for the day. The choice of international cuisine, ranging from fruits, fruit juices to Continental, North Indian, South Indian, was just marvellous.   The gym facilities were excellent. The professional staff were always there to help and guide you.  We would like to comment a few of the staff, namely Chef Vijay Singh Dhanai, Chef Dvipal Mehta,  Executive Chef Mandar"
896,"No doubt, one expects everything, when you choose a 5 Star for your Stay, and the expectations increases more, when you are talking about Marriot.   Other than the gread food quality, quick room service and other nice amenities. I would like to take a minute and specially mention couple of names. These staff went an extra mile, to make the stay more pleasent. Team like this is definately an asset for any corporate.  Sarfaraz - Duty Manager  Vikas from Front Desk   and Melvin    Keep up the good work guys !!!"
897,"This is my sixth stay at the JW Marriott Juhu Beach.  As usual, the service is top notched and truly adds to an enjoyable stay.  The executive lounge staff takes care of your every need.  Once again, however, it is the wonderful massage specialist, Rupesh, that I can't say enough positives about.  Flying for 22 hours to get here and knowing that aches and pains will be washed away by his touch is amazing.  Expect the most out of everyone here and you will get it."
898,"I‚Äôd like to point out at the outset that this a nice luxury hotel with polite staff, good amenities and (more or less) clean rooms, nice food and ambience. What made us scratch our heads was some poor decisions made by the staff with regards to us and our room. At the outset our receptionist took our ID cards and didn‚Äôt give it back to us till we asked on the day we checked out. It‚Äôs astonishing they didn‚Äôt have the forethought to search the database and send it to our rooms as soon as they were discovered, which would have reduced our panic when we could not find them later on in the room. Or the fact that we took the Juhu suite with the honeymoon package with late checkout at 6pm but were asked by the hotel to leave by 12:00 ( the receptionist that called us didn‚Äôt believe us"
899,"We decided to do a stay cation for our 2nd anniversary and chose the Marriott at Juhu. Excellent choice. There was a Rampuri food festival that was going on where we tasted some exquisite food. In general, the staff was very helpful, especially the Club Marriott staff who were extremely responsive and courteous."
900,Very nice hotel in a prime location.All the staff was friendly and professional.Hotel needs to spend some money in designing to be rated 5 star.Had nice rooms and a good buffet breakfast with a lot of variety.In the buffet service can be improved as gets too busy.Nice pools and access to Juhu Beach.Very close to some designer shops.
901,Checked in for three days with friends I have stayed here before the distance from the airport is 20 minutes arrived early no rooms available but they did organise complimentary breakfast which was nice. The room was lovely with partial ocean view. Overall the staff were extremely friendly and really helpful. If you have time go for a massage recommend it highly. The only downside for me was asking me to pay for something I didn‚Äôt have. I settled my account the night before because we were leaving quite early at that time she wanted me to pay for some alcoholic drinks we never had she looked into it admitted it was a mistake. Next morning when I handed my room keys back in more alcoholics drinks were booked to my room how can that be when I closed my account the night before so
902,This place is amongst my favourite restaurants in town. And by far the best Buffet place in the City. The selection of deserts in the buffet is mind blowing.  The staff hair is very warm friendly and helpful.  Special mention to Siddesh and Vikram.  Are usual order is butter chicken and dal makhni.  But it is also my favourite place for weekend pizza. Overall grade Vibe and great food. Thumbs up.
903,"hotel itself is impressive from outside while the actual room is not at the level you would expect for the price. the acoustics is not so good, you can hear clearly anyone passes at the corridor. I stayed at top floor in two different rooms and heard some strange wind noises at the night. besides that, shower and soups were great all hotel members try their best to give good service, at breakfast they keep asking if everything is OK - some people like it. had some problem with the bill upon check out - pay attention to what is written the area aroud - nothing much to do except for walking to the beach (sea is very dirty in Mumbai so you can't go in)"
904,"If you have the chance - and can get into the  concierge lounge - ask for Junaid, and experience his pancakes. The lounge is first class with a fantastic selection. The pancakes.... ask for Junaid - it‚Äôs gotta be Junaid"
905,This was rated as number one on trip advisor so we had to give it a whirl. To be honest it was quite disappointing. It's more style over substance. The staff are very attentive and the food looks great. That's where others fairytale ends. We are vegetarian and the food was very tempting but lacked depth and flavour. Two of the dishes were extremely salty and I regret not bringing that to the attention of the chef's. The sweet counter was good but again reminded me of deserts in an cheap buffet restaurant. The Vege savoury starters were good Pani Puri and sev bhel etc station was the star. Overall for the price which for us was just over ¬£70 UK for two persons is ok for UK but considering what was available for less then half that price not worth the money. We may have got better
906,Ivan and Kumar assisted us in confirming our access to the lounge. They turned an embarrassing moment for us into a great experience during our stay. The lounge is a pleasant place to start the morning and to wind up a busy day. Nothing more be said but thanks.
907,"Relaxed at this resort everyday after shopping. Staff at lotus cafe Kailash, Satish, chef Mehta are great. Chef Mansi and staff at Executive lounge were superb. Saffron, Mezzo Mezzo good food. Chauffeur Suresh Patel excellent."
908,JW Marriott Juhu is better than its branch in Sahar. The Sahar branch is near to the airport. Room is quite spacious and service is prompt. Good hygiene. Juhu beach is right infront of the hotel. Restaurants are also good.
909,"After a long volunteer surgical mission in Jaipur and Thane, the team needed a little treat before heading off and this hotel fit the bill. It's super close to the airport, so traffic is not too much of an issue. And, the pillows are divine as is the rest of the bedding. Breakfast has a fantastic spread and food suitable for all palates. Too bad we stayed for only one night."
910,i really love the restaurant downstairs because its so lit up and calm and nice and me and my date had some really great conversation having the coffee so i have to rate the experience amazing. I have been here multiple times.
911,"We stayed at the Marriott for 5 nights and it was one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in.  ALL the staff, from the front desk Concierge, to the room cleaners were so friendly and helpful.  The food was remarkable as well.  I have never slept in such a comfortable bed and if I could have brought it home I would have. I would go back in a heart beat - just wonderful visit.  Hated to leave...."
912,"Stayed here 2 nights.  I could not give this a 5 star as the check in and check out process was way too long.  Long from the standpoint of someone being able to assist and long in that inevitably, there are more and more papers to be printed and then stapled and then signed.  Upon checking in, there were 2 hotel people working the desk.  Checking out there was 1 person.  This doesn't work and doesn't provide a great experience.  Other than that, the hotel is very nice.  Nice lobby area, nice shopping area with books, and bakery, coffee and knick knacks.  The rooms are well appointed albeit a bit small but very workable.  My iron wasn't working so I called down for a replacement and I had it within 10 minutes.  The bathroom/toilet/sink and shower areas were modern and clean.  A"
913,"Best Site, Well Furnished Hotel & Rooms, Well Mannered and Cooperative staff, Fast Services, Lavish Food in Breakfast. Superfast wifi.  Parking a lot, Big and Best Lobby. Very Beautiful Dining Area, Big swimming pool/spa. Can stay here for more than one week."
914,Lotus cafe is great. Excellent service...especially Mayur. Overall this is a great place to stay. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Excelent rooms and food throughout. Highly recomended for a stay in this great city.
915,"I visited JW Marriott Juhu last week with my sisters. The service was great from the moment we checked in, we were upgraded and provided interconnecting rooms as requested.  The breakfast buffet was amazing with lots of fresh fruit and juices. A special thanks to Dvipal Mehta, Sous Chef who personally came over every morning to say hello and make sure we had all that we wanted. The hotel kindly arranged a complimentary transfer to the airport for us.  All in all a very pleasant stay and we will definite visit again."
916,"I stayed here in January 2018 and I was very impressed. High quality, great staff, everything worked well. Room was fine, but basic. Price was reasonable.   The highlight was this: I got sick with a flu / chest infection and the observant room cleaner worked it out from the various medicines lying around the room. Next thing, a manager turned up with flowers and offer to get a doctor. Very switched on.   Big shout out to Aniket at breakfast. Anil was also terrific. Ashay at reception and Shekhar in the (well appointed) gym were also very helpful.   Definitely a great place to stay."
917,I had booked 2 club rooms here for 3 nights at the end of December.  From the check in to to check out we were treated like royalty.  Yeh staff couldn‚Äôt do enough.  A special mention to Michael in the Club Lounge who was charming and couldn‚Äôt do enough for the four of us.  He even managed to get a bag we had left on our plane to Mumbai returned to us at the hotel.   What an asset to J W Marriot.  Also the chef Maansi at the club lounge who ensured we always had something special especially for my daughter!    Definitely recommend this hotel.  It‚Äôs was the most relaxing stay I had on this trip to India. I‚Äôll be back!!
918,"I booked to stay at the JW Marriott in Juhu for 3 days to attend a wedding in Mumbai, the reviews were great and the pictures were good so I decided to book with Marriott. I arrived very early in the morning at 1:30 AM, my room was not ready, so decided to get some food, the coffee shop was open, but my word inspite of the huge coffee shop the place stank and the worst part was the ""food"", it was atrocious, we ordered Indian food, and one would think they cant get that wrong in India, but boy was I wrong.  on top of all that the food was pricey and the service was ridiculous.   i ordered room servie a cafe latte in the morning and they brought my coffee in a cup filled to 20% capacity and I asked the bell boy if this was indeed 'caffe latte' and he said 'yes' looking straight"
919,"Stayed early of 2017, being a member of Club Marriott for the last couple of years  Property is 7*, Service could be moved up a notch (same issues less staff specially in Lotus Cafe), Food is 7* specially for Non Vegetarians But Veggies like us would give it 4* Reception is painstaking slow both for check in and check out.  Rooms cannot point but staying in suite was great specially the view of the beach from the tub. Hotel has access to the beach no issues. Swimming pool is great both for kids and adults.  Ambience, Decor, Security, Kid Friendly, Infrastructure, Food, are essentially 7*'s  One of the few hotels where I have seen the GM - Sharad doing rounds and more visible than any other stays I have had. Residence Manager Viktor same goes also.  Lotus Cafe staff do not lack"
920,"Hi I had recently visited your hotel on 17th jan‚Äô18 for meeting a friend. Absolutely loved the place. Also, I would like to make a special mention about on of your employees at the front desk, Ms. Devanshi. While I was waiting in the lobby area, I saw this lady who seemed to be extremely young yet working really hard and making sure everything is done right. I‚Äôve visited quite a few hotels to stay and just for meetings too, but this was one of the warmest experiences.  My best regards to the hotel and to Devanshi.  Thank you"
921,"So I have stayed in quite a bit over the years , and spend a lot of money in this hotel, both me and my wife came last year and had an awful experience but the issues where resolved and I was compensated - that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here again to give the j w Marriott in juju one more try and they messed that up within 5 mins of entering the hotel!!!!! I will not be staying here again I will spend my cash elsewhere - the hotel staff belittled me Infront of other guests when my card was declined !! They shouted about it and other guests where looking and talking which really upsets me ! And my wife my card was not declined my bank stopped the transaction for my safety - because I‚Äôm rich and it was for our safety! Had you kept records and informed your staff correctly you would know I‚Äôm"
922,It was nice to see very busy hotel and good room .We booked premier room with lounge access by paying additional charge of 100$ and it was disappointing to see every one struggling to get place to sit around 6pm and relax at the end of day.We asked lounge staff whether we can come later and response was food will not be there after 8pm .I felt luxury we wanted turned into struggle .It is absolute essence to improve comforts and additional period to have food in lounge in order not every one to rush.We have stayed here often and it is the best hotel to stay with all comforts and luxury .
923,In the last week I had visited the hotel with my family our flight was delayed and we were accommodated in this lovely hotel. A few guest's were arabic they couldn't understand English so there was this young girl in the lobby named Diana she helped one of the guest my using a translator in her cell phone and helped her in communicating with others. This was a very wonderful gesture that was shown in helping the guest. We really had a wonderful stay though it was for few hours it was wonderful. Even the other employees are very hard-working. Great hotel to stay in.
924,Nice rooms and large spacious and multi cuisine dinning including breakfast. Hotel cars and service are exceptional as well. We were travelling with 2 year old and had no issues.the swimming pool area is good. Hotel location is extraordinary.
925,I had forgotten my Marriott reward points number. Many of the staff individuals politely declined from helping me out in retrieving my reward points number. But Ms.Vini Bachani at the JW Mariott reception helped me out in retrieving this information. That too by making an international call to Kuala Lumpur (where they got the database). I deeply appreciate her efforts in helping me out especially when she could have taken a similar approach like her colleagues.
926,"The hotel staff at check -in was very welcoming. I was upgraded to a suite with a beautiful view of the beach as well as the swimming pools.   The rooms are very comfortable, the elevators come rapidly after I pressed the button; the hotel is clean and the service is impressive.  The executive lounge staff deserves to be thanked for the hospitality as well as courtesy. Concierge in the lounge---Surti was very knowledgeable and helpful.   We felt very welcome during our stay. The fitness center has state of the art machines and is clean. The steam room is comfortable.  Buffet in Lotus Lounge is a feast and the service is impeccable.  I am not sure how effective the security in the lobby is; I presume it is a necessity.   Access to the beach is thru the pool area. The steps in"
927,"We stayed at this hotel over New Year's, checked in on the 31st Dec for 4 nights. I have been lucky enough to have been to Mumbai before and had on one previous occasion dined at the hotel; therefore knew what to expect in terms of location and general aesthetic, but this hotel still didn't disappoint. Arrival: We arrived with a privately booked mini-bus as we were a family of 8 people. The hotel looks a bit blocked off from the road with the high walls, so you don't completely get a sense of the hotel from the road. There is a slight confusion from which gate you can enter with a mini-bus, as the first gate is for cars only - this caused some minor confusion for us. The arrival at the porte-cocher was very pleasant and the staff greeted us politely while opening the doors and"
928,"We have recently celebrated an engagement dinner at Saffron. The food is absolutely authentic and very well prepared - they were able to cater to our rather fussy palates. Service was exceptional - our server Swagat, was able to balance being exceedingly attentive with the discretion one expects during a family meal. If you're lucky you'll get him for your shift. Highly recommended"
929,"Was an ok please to be in. Staff tries their best to accommodate but manager we dealt with seemed inattentive, nonaccomodating, and no help at all. All he could say was the typical phrases taught him to deal with any issues.pretty disappointed to say that we have always stayed with jw Marriott's wherever we go.  Faced quite a few problems coz of staffs carelessness, but didn't make an issue of it coz we knew it will not be dealt with and our time will only be wasted. Not much faith in this place anymore."
930,I visited this place with very little expectation as I was hungry... I was delighted with the service and the warmth extended. There was a little girl called Devanshi ... She made us feel at home and what a superstar you guys have got. Wish her all the luck. Excellent food and the layout. Highly recommended.
931,"Review is a bit late but the extra mile that staff went to make our stay comfortable and special compelled me to write it. Have stayed here annually for the past 5-6 years and was soo happy to see they have finally renovated their rooms!! It was a big downer last time as rooms, even suites were in pathetic condition but no more. The front desk staff is also amazing now, no hiccups with check-ins like in the past so a huge kudos to the staff and front desk manager.  Big shout out to Neha Kapoor as she is true gem for this place!! If you are reading this, thank you again for the sandesh!Things have improved tremendously since she has been managing. She really knows her industry and customer well and goes out of her way to make your stay special. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about"
932,Great location as fairly central. Reception was excellent and impeccable service. Some minor issues were sorted out quickly with apologies despite the hotel being completely full at the time. Room was clean and bed comfortable. The food was amazing - put on a few kilos very quickly. The Italian restaurant had great food and again the service was very friendly and mindful. There were many parties going on but there was no interference from these. The housekeeping staff were again very prompt fulfilling any requests.  Taxis and autos are easy to get if needed.Went to spa once and the experience was good.  The staff everywhere were amazing!!! I can't name everyone and I can't name only a few.
933,"Probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  We were welcomed into a grand lobby and reception area with views across the hotel with the pool and sea in the distance.  Check in was a breeze and the deluxe rooms are very modern and elegant with a luxury feel.    The Lotus Cafe has a stunning buffet breakfast with a great mix of Indian and western choices.  There's also lovely live music in the background at the top of the stairs looking over the entire restaurant.  The service at breakfast was amazing, and were greeted by staff every morning, including the Lotus Cafe manager.   Saffron (Indian restaurant) is equally amazing and served a delicious dinner during our stay.  The service at this hotel is second to none.  My mum had stomach pains during the night at around 2am"
934,"Spent a delightful four nights at the hotel. What impressed me the most, aside from the beach location, was that all staff we encountered were friendly and ready to make our stay enjoyable. This was especially true of the manager of customer relations who I contacted before arrival. Throughout our stay we continued to meet her at crucial times when she was able to aid us in our travel needs. I certainly would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted a great location, great food and very supportive hotel staff."
935,"I cannot say enough kind things about this hotel. From the moment we entered the Lobby, the staff made us feel special and personalised the stay to our needs, which were both personal and professional. Samantha and her Concierge Team helped with a tour operator who failed to show up and coordinated a new tour for my wife; that evening, my wife had a note with a Ganesha Elephant gift awaiting her return, compliments of Guest Services. Michael and Kumar in the Club Lounge greeted us each day and made sure we had everything we needed and more; in addition, the chef in the Club Lounge came around to ask if there was anything she could prepare for us. The Fitness Center is more like a true Gym with amazing faciities and a terrific energy level. We also used the Relaxation Rooms each"
936,"I have been going to the coffee shop for many years now and every time I come to India I make sure I go there- simply because of the rich experience it gives me and my family. When you go to paces like the JW Marriott and alike you expect the food to be top shelf anyway but what defines the experience is the service and personalisation of it all. I don't usually write these unless I feel compelled to do so, my last visit I was greeted by a staff Aninket who immediately caught my attention as he greeted me with, "" welcom back Sir!"" Now I don't expect anyone to remember me but this familiarity and personal touch is what makes a lasting experience... as they say it's not what you do or say it's how you make one feel... So thank you Aninket!! You have delivered a supreme experience"
937,Spent just a couple of days earlier in January with my wife. Upgraded to a ocean view room. Whilst the rooms aren‚Äôt the biggest - they are very comfy!  We wanted to relax and spent most time within the hotel. The pool is beautiful. Next to the beach with brilliant views of the sunset. The coffee shop has amazing views of he beach and the pool. Breakfast was scrumptious. No complains. Will definitely visit  again.
938,"Have stayed many times and all facilities are very good and standards usually high.  Had a few hiccups this time for two night stay and as a Marriott Rewards member was disappointed.  I arrived at 1 p.m. and was well aware check-in is 3 p.m. so was prepared to have lunch but was told my allocated room - Deluxe, Double Bed, Ocean View, Pool View, Lounge privileges - was occupied and would not be vacated until after 3 p.m. and then it had to be cleaned, etc.  So I asked for another room but being Christmas-time I was told they were very busy.  After 30 minutes was given twin bedded room otherwise as previously described on 3rd floor.  I handed over my credit card for extras and it was acknowledged as card used to make reservation.  The tv did not work so had three visits from"
939,We must say that the staff at the Lotus cafe coffee shop goes an extra mile to make u comfortable.Mr.Jazib Hussain and Mr.Sohum the managers take very good care.A special mention for Mr.Aniket who was very hospitable.We feel as if we r at a home away from home.
940,"I stayed here with my son in early November 2017. We had a fantastic time here, thanks to the friendly staff at the executive lounge. People are nice in India, but this was the most welcoming hotel I have ever experienced.  The hotel is located at Juhu beach, but noone seems to swim in the ocean. However, JWM has a large pool where water and towels are free, It is nice to take a walk outside the hotel and the area seems to be very safe."
941,I had visited along with my girlfriend for celebrate her birthday and the lotus Cafe team made this awesome.  Thank you very much for your lovely service hospitality.  Special thank to Avinash Mashalkar who had given personalized service to us and very much co-operative.  Thank you Avinash your service is very much appreciated. God bless you keep the same spirit and keep smiling service.
942,Stayed there again after a break of a few months. The place was as good as before. The staff we so charged. The swimming pool right next to the beach is too good. It feels like you are on vacation in the middle of your business trip. Really worth a visit.
943,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Beautiful hotel & grounds, great facilities. Big thanks to Neeta at the Spa & the guys at Lotus Cafe who went out of their way for my birthday, and also to Asif for your smiley face everyday, you all made our stay extra special.   All the staff are awesome and very accommodating, the room was clean and comfortable. Buffet breakfast was awesome.   Only negative thing I‚Äôd say is that I was really looking forward to champagne next to the pool at the pool bar, and from the pics that was a big reason we booked so was quite disappointed when I wasn‚Äôt able to have a drink and relax at the pool.   Otherwise a fabulous stay ÔøΩ"
944,"Originally I was assigned to stay at a hotel chain partnered with the company I worked for, but after meeting a friend staying at the J.W. Marriott, I was pleased to spend most of my time at this location rather than my own hotel. As such, I've actually cancelled my upcoming reservation this weekend at the company hotel, and booked instead at the J.W. I must say that the service at the hotel was exceptional. Granted I am a happy person, but my every smile was answered in turn by a smile from the hotel staff! The pool was stunning, and I must admit I spent a fair amount of time enjoying the beauty of the pool area! As for the food, I was given a nice introduction to the cuisine of the area, and I'm looking forward to furthering that study. The Italian restaurant also gives NYC a"
945,I had an amazing breakfast and was severed really well ‚ù§ hope to have a visit again  The ambience of the cafe is very nice and attractive ... My family had a great time at the cafe  Thank you for this service
946,"Everything about this hotel well thought out and great! The rooms are the nicest in India The staff at the front desk anticipates every need and is so nice! The restaurants are some of the best in all of Mumbai! The Lounge is well run, organized, and has great food. The hotel is on the beach, and is also close to the airport. Even the hotel cars are amazing!  They come to get you in a BMW, Audi, or Range Rover!  I cannot say anything bad about this hotel, but I can give special thanks to both Priyanka at the front desk and Michael in the Lounge both of whom make my visits even more perfect!  They are both amazing employees who make the JW that much better!"
947,"After an appalling one night stay at sea princess hotel we switched hotels to jw Marriott. What a difference in experience for a similar price !! This hotel is a 5 star hotel from the ambience to the food and to the whole attitude of the staff. I bought a Mandir during my stay here and the housekeeper noticed that it was there in the room and came around with the manager and gave us a Ganesha to put in the Mandir as it was empty. What a touch. Truly special. The laundry we had done was pristine and packaged beautifully. We had visitors come and join us for dinner at the hotel and the staff could not be more accommodating ! The rooms are very clean and super comfortable and fruit is put into the room every day so that you can have a snack in the day if you wish. The breakfast ,"
948,This is second time i stay at this property. The checkin experience was average. Room provided had AC problem. Earlier requests of room near elevator since few days before checkin was not taken into consideration.   The room was changed and it was further from elevator. Overall rooms are very small and not very inviting.   The turndown service was average. The breakfast spread  was excellent.   I had dinner in the restaurant and it was alright. Serious spice issue and being a five star should take into account that international guests.  Checkout experience was good. Overall great location but hotel losing its charm.
949,"This hotel does not feel like one. The entire time I stayed at JW, I felt as though I was on a resort. I felt pampered the entire time spent here. JW made me feel like royalty. I would come back to Mumbai just to visit the hotel. There is so much to do inside, The pools were so much fun and so beautiful. The restaurants were so amazing. I will be thinking about the food I ate here for years to come. This hotel stay will be very hard to top. Thank you JW for not being overbearing and for the lovely stay. I hope to visit again."
950,"Fantastic Hotel, Very Friendly Staff, Excellent Breakfast, Great Location, Access to the Beach ,The Spa was brilliant. The toilitories in the room were first class.  I mean I can just go on.   This was a Family holiday and the hotel helped us enjoy thoroughly.  Greeting with a Namste instead of the colonial greetings floored all of us completely.  I only wish hotel could do something about the traffic on the roads around them."
951,"I stayed here with my family between 21th December 2017 - 23rd December 2017 (2x Executive Ocean View Rooms) and again between 30th December2017 - 3rd January 2018 (1x Junior Suite). The reason why we chose this hotel is that my family had stayed there in the past and spoke extremely highly of the JW Marriott in Juhu.  Staff were very friendly upon arrival and the check in was flawless. Concierge were extremely helpful when their assistance was required.  Firstly, the breakfast.... The variety of food at breakfast was excellent and there really is something for everyone at the buffet. On our first round of our stay we were up quite early and found that when the breakfast buffet was not too busy the staff were very attentive. However, on the second round of our stay we were at"
952,"Increasingly I‚Äôm spending more time in India on business and have therefore been lucky enough to stay in many of the best hotels Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi has to offer. To this end I have to say that The JW Marriott is my now favourite Hotel in Mumbai.   First of all it‚Äôs located on a beach so you wake up to a bright and beautiful view, which is always a great way to start your day!  The food is fantastic, albeit local and regional curries from the vast buffet, or western dishes from the boutique restaurants. Whilst nothing is ‚Äòcheap‚Äô, when you consider the hotel and its surroundings, the food is of a very good quality and standard and therefore still great value for money.   The staff are awesome! Everyone is very friendly and attentive yet without being intrusive. On one"
953,Excellent hotel with good facilities. The staff are helpful and efficient. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the rubbish food at the executive lounge - cold soup and Indian street food which gave me food poisoning. Beware of eating there.
954,What a perfect ending location/hotel for our family's first trip to india.  The hotel staff are exceptionally pleasant and helpful.  The visit to the executive lounge was always a perfect way to end/ wind down our day after battling the streets of Mumbai during the day. Special mention to Ansh & Michael who were always there to assist especially the new home remedy Toddy that was specially brewed up to help with sickness üòä The Lotus cafe staff too were exceptional in their daily command of duty during the busy breakfast times and always still being able to smile & put up such a huge variety to chose from.  Special mention to the manager Jazbi.  Overall amazing stay. Thank you assisting in ending our trip on such a  pleasant note. The kids thought this was the best hotel in all
955,"Getting a room on the 3rd floor with a view to the Indian ocean/Juhu beach will give the best view. They have 3 restaurants, italina, japanese and indian, all of them offer great food. Alcohol is availabe inside the restaurans and the hotel bar only. The pool are can get crouded late morning to late afternoon, evening is best. The hotel help is gret value if you want to get a reasonable depedable taxi to go around the city. I negotiated a price of  1800 rupies  from 10 AM to 11 PM on a Saturday to view the city, grate deal. The beach is accessible from the hotel but do not go into the water. Overall a great place"
956,Had an excellent two night stay here. The staff were all very polite and always on the look out to see if you needed anything to make your stay more comfortable. I want to especially comment on the staff that worked at the Lotus caf√© where the breakfast spread was incredible. The staff here went above and beyond and I would especially like to thank Aniket and Shivam they both are a credit to the hotel. Would definitely return
957,"We booked the JW Juhu for our five day stay last week of December.  Am usually a SPG regular and this was my first at JW, so was a bit apprehensive, but they provided adequate recognition including upgrade to a suite on check in.  Very elegant property, excellent service from all staff, good beach access, Swimming pool, relaxed atmosphere- a resort feeling in the middle of the city.  The only area for improvement I would suggest would be the lounge especially during evening cocktails- it was extremely crowded and difficult to get a seat or service, am still rating a five star as the staff tried their best but was simply overwhelmed due to the rush."
958,"We have always had a very very bad experience at front desk in the last two years . I have been visiting this property for many years n this kind of clueless fresh trainees are a very sad scene to see in such a wonderful property . People who really made smiles come on our faces n were very courteous were Neha front office head  Samantha , Vijay BBC N servers Aniket n Sameer . Thank you all"
959,In the heart of Juhu ... on the beach ... Class style and elegance .Beautiful surrounding ... a must ... excellent service and friendly staff ... great for shopping in the Santa Cruz area ....excellent breakfast ...
960,"I definitely recommend JW Marriot Mumbhai to everyone. If you are stopping . in mumbhai you must stay in this hotel. I cannot fault it at all. Currently I am stopping in room 154 and all I can say the staff are all polite, the rooms are so clean, spacious and amazing. Very peaceful cannot hear the guest from next door.  The pool decor was out of this world , so peaceful and quiet in the pool area. The buffet breakfast downstairs caters for 600 but the service  was good as they are so efficient .  The staff take everything in their stride even when rude customer speak to them.  The only disappointing thing was the artist that you had for New Year‚Äôs Eve was the worse singer I have heard and I have been to many parties. We left early disappointed"
961,Superb hotel with luxury pools next to the famous Juhu beach. Access to the public beach is restricted due to security reasons (must return by 7pm) but lovely place to take a stroll (thanks to the volunteers who have really cleaned up this beach). Try the buffet which has a variety of dishes from all over the world.
962,I don‚Äôt understand the reason for the awful smell though. The food is okay. I‚Äôve had much much better. Their service is very good. The decor is stunning.  The air conditioning doesn‚Äôt work well when there‚Äôs a huge crowd.
963,Had a short overnight stay here and the stay were excellent. Only in the hotel for 6 hours due to business trip to Goa but the staff were helpful and the club sandwich excellent. Good service from everyone we met. Thank you
964,"Excellent hotel .. awesome  food ,had a great time hear .. service was mind blowing .. smiling and courteous staff .. thanks a lot Rupesh for the great service.. would like to recommend these hotel to all my friends and family members"
965,"We stayed at JW Marriott@Juhu, Mumbai for 4 nights from 25th December to 29th December for our winter vacations and without beating about the bush, we were sorely disappointed with our experience.  We started on a positive note, though, as the check-in was smooth and efficient.  The rooms were pleasant enough with a view of the Juhu beach and the Arabian sea. However, the lack of lock in the washroom area was galling considering we were travelling with small kids. Maybe a small latch lock could be installed by the management for the guest's peace of mind!  Another aspect of the hotel which we found annoying was their insistence on paying for your in-room dining orders at the time of delivery of your order- Usually the in-room dining orders are charged to your room, which the"
966,"Wanted to treat my mother to have a fine meal so what place other than Firdaus @Taj Krishna. Food , ambience , service all top notch.The food was outstanding. Haleem, biryani and the kababs were to die for. What made our dinner memorable was the outstanding service"
967,Stayed for 3 nights on a business trip. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful as it was our first trip to mumbai.  The breakfast was superb and the selection extremely wide catering for all tastes.  The hotel itself was centrally located for the purpose of our travel which helped.also restaurants available walking distance from the hotel.  I wish I had more free time to enjoy the pool and spa which looked amazing. I did manage to use the fitness centre as that was open  24hrs a day.  Definately will recommend this hotel
968,Amazing Buffet great service given by Mr.Aniket properly n timely Loved it specially The strawberry milkshake was also deserve a five-star is already loved feel like coming to the food fresh food and healthy life
969,"Stayed for three nights only in Mumbai and one night in Pune. The hotel is close and convenient to airport, lovely modern rooms and great breakfast and dinner buffet.Very comfortable beds, pillows, and has a nice pool area."
970,"The staf is very attentive catering to all the needs of me and the family. The hotel is really nice and up to date both inside and outside. The kids really appreciated the childrens pool. The best start of the stay was getting a superb start with the breakfast buffet. The selection and Quality was very high and the staf made our children feel really special, especially Anil and Avinash put in am extra effort. I recommend the hotel for both business and families looking to explore Mumbai."
971,Truly the best experience of a buffet i have ever had!!! The chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious and it was perfect display of gourmet dining. Will surely encourage more friends and family to come here
972,"I was allocated a fabulous sea facing room, had an upgrade to an executive room, it was lovely.  The whole hotel was well maintained, and a has a wow factor. The restaurants were wonderful, as as the pool area."
973,"This hotel lives up to the expectations of a five star resort. The hotel itself is very well maintained, clean and decorated well for the festive season (Christmas). The rooms were clean and room service was excellent. Karim from housekeeping did a great job keeping the room fresh and clean each day. The Lotus Caf√© is a great place to dine, with a vast variety of food choices. I would really encourage getting the package with breakfast included. The breakfast is well worth it. Even dinner has a wide variety to choose from. All the servers and managers make sure the guests are well taken care of, Sagar, Anil, Jazib and Sachin to name a few. On the main level, Bombay Bread Company is an excellent place to stop by for salads and sandwiches. They have great quality bread and the"
974,"This is a superb place to stay in Mumbai, and a return visit to this very good hotel ! Most importantly the staff here from the moment you enter the premises are so friendly, and accommodating, and care about their clientele. My wife assures me that the Spa was fantastic ! The beds are so comfortable, and the rooms kept immaculate during our entire stay.  Nothing is too much trouble. Attached Letter sent to the F & B Manager:  ""Dear Mr Pereira,  I am writing to thank you, and your team for looking after us so well in your restaurant during our 4 day stay at your hotel. The quality, and choice of cuisine has been exceptional, and it is clear that your team take considerable pride, and passion in the work that they do, offering ‚Äúsilver service‚Äù with a smile. We thank you and your"
975,Great service! The staff were excellent and really took care of us.  Especially at dinner.  What a great atmosphere and they made my 94 year old gran feel so special.  Lovely hotel and would stay there again!
976,my self kamlesh gupta from Chicago I come every year and stay here in jw marriott your staff is amazing this time Anil (lotus caffe)is helping me his service is awesome and he is very friendly that why I like to come here because your staff is amazing
977,"This is the 5th time in 2 years that we have stayed at this property! Every time it only gets better and this is all due to the great hospitality from the staff:  Front desk: We were checked in again very smoothly and this is all due to Priyanka ( In Guest Relations). Priyanka has always been very professional, hospitable and has the can do attitude. Along with her special thanks goes to Neha Kapoor ( front office Assistant manager) and Samantha Pererra ( Guest Relations manager). Both Neha and Samantha always made sure for 10 days that we were well looked after!  Concierge: Special thanks again to Luis Gomes for doing everything and beyond and for always smiling!  Lotus cafe: Special thanks to Nishad, Mr. Mehta, Stanley, Kunal ( cut my fruits daily), Anil and Satish the great"
978,"Hi I have visited Mumbai 4 times and on each visit the JW Marriott Hotel has not disappointed me. This time I stayed on for 8 nights and was most comfortable.  From the impressive lobby and pool area, up to and and including all the helpful staff- beginning at the concierge desk, throughout the check-in and check-out counters, the various restaurant staff, as well as all the polite and helpful house keeping services especially Asif who was assigned to my room, my stay has been a wonderful experience.  I love the ambiance of the hotel and how you are transported to a completely different space the moment you step into the hotel.  There are a few persons whom I would love to mention; Tanvi from the saffron restaurant who indulged us with the most delicious complimentary ice cream"
979,"The service was top class - from the pick up at the airport and all the way through the drop off. The willingness to serve is obvious, and they do it very well. Always appreciate seeing people liking what they do, and I picked up that sense with the staff at the hotel. The poolside is a nice place to get a breather and relax. I had a very pleasant stay and I would definitely get a room at the JW Marriott JUHU on my next visit to Mumbai."
980,"We have been there one time, Sunday brunch is the best among all. Spread of food is unbelievable, tasty is mind blowing. The best part is desert section, for chocolate lovers, this buffet is a paradise."
981,"Amazing gym great trainers, spa staff, bar tenders ... the level of service everywhere is amazing :)  These guys and gals here....from the doorman to restaurant managers....know what customer service stands for....they know how to make you feel special.  Kudos to the entire Jw Marriott team in juhu mumbai."
982,"Excellent service right from checking in to housekeeping. Room is spacious, ,modern and well maintained with all modern amenities. We had a sea facing room, which added to the holiday experience. Housekeeping is prompt and very obliging.All restaurants,fine dining and worth it!"
983,"We celebrated our anniversary and we were surprised many times with small gestures and gifts which included cakes, wine, flowers etc..  It‚Äôs not about the freebies they gave but the effort to make it a memorable personalized event with the little things.  Loved the lotus cafe breakfast buffet, must have !! Worth every penny.  Though I don‚Äôt remember name of everyone who made our trip awesome, but I will call out a few who I remember.  Lotus Cafe AniKet  Sanket Kailash Sagar Chef - Vipul  Quan Spa  Pravin Sachin  Gunjan  Room cleaning service - Great !   Executive lounge service - Great !   Beautiful clean pool and private access to beach.  To sum it up - Impeccable  service !!!"
984,"I stayed at the property for two nights during a short stay in Mumbai.  The property has a luxurious vibe and very well kept/clean.  I really liked the open concept layout on the main floor/lobby and the cafe, Bombay Baking Company, was a cool place to hangout.   Room was smaller than usual for a Marriott (maybe because of the city; similar to New York hotel room sizes), but they were very comfortable. We were upgraded to a Beach View room, due to gold elite status, which was an added bonus!   The front desk staff was very helpful both in person and using the new chat function in the Marriott App; it was a great experience and everything was taken care of from hiring a car to laundry.   I would have given the review five stars, but I had a negative experience both times I went"
985,Great 2 day stay at my old standby luxury home away from home. There are so many new luxury hotel choices in Mumbai but the service at Juhu JW Just keeps me coming back. I Especially want to recognize the Lotus Cafe staff for  their great breakfast staff with Kailasb and Satish going above and beyond!  Thanks for the attentive service!!
986,"Visited this Hotel for an Event and Had a Bad Experience on Professional Approach of the Reception Team on Info of Venue and Know How about the Event , Next was the Service at the Event , Found the Waiters not Professional Of Attentiveness to Guest on Service was missed out by 4 of them on a Huge Table and only visited to Server 3 Times , More Resting than Service ! Event was a Dell EMC & Redington Event ! But was Very Dissapointed on Service , First Visit to this Hotel and a Bad Experience ."
987,My stay at the JW Marriott Juhu was amazing my favourite brand of Hotel of all time amazing stay amazing stuff amazing food amazing view everything was up to date everything was neat and clean I liked it awesome to all the staff of JW Marriott
988,"Lovely property, the ambience and sea view from the main dining room is incredible. The staff are very warm and welcoming and very responsive. I was disappointed with the food though other than breakfast, and we tried the Japanese and Italian  restaurants, in addition to the buffet arrangements. They have a lovely bakery too.  Of course, you can bump into Hollywood celebrities all day long!"
989,"People at this hotel are so helpful. Great location. Very nice rooms and restaurants to choose. If you can, you want to stay on the executive level Local places to walk to. Great pool area overseeing the Sea. Bathrooms in the rooms are well stocked, nice shower, not sure if they have rooms with tubs."
990,"Seriously.. 5 stars aren't enough. Adjectives aren't enough. They spoiled us.  We stayed in Ocean View executive room. The room itself would have won my heart. It was amazing. Like a slice of heaven , which was ours for three days. There are not enough words to describe this room. It was a amazing space, I mean I had a bathtub viewing the ocean.. (need i say more) Worth every penny!!!!   Now comes the part where we were spoiled. The executive lounge where everyone with executive rooms (not just suites) have access to.The staff are so so amazing and nice. Not because its just their jobs, but because they genuinely love to make you happy. They were like genies making every wish come true.  Ivan, Sashikant, Michael, thanks for the endless supply of vada pavs and samosas and"
991,Disappointing experience. Went for lunch with business relationship. Staff was too busy to take care of guests. The managers excuse was that few of staff members were freshers. A hotel like Marriott should be able to do better.
992,Checked in 2 hours ago and had a power cut in our room 3 times already! Not an issue across the whole hotel just our room! Not good at all! Taken 4 trips down to reception to sort the issue out and still waiting!
993,"For a Fine Dining Restaurant, all that was noteworthy was perhaps the decor and that too, if at all!  The volume of the music was fit only for deaf ears, as was its choice.  The food, abhor-able to say the least. Sushi at its worst. The sea food (every variety) straight out of the freezer, zapped to thaw and served!  All that hoop-la about one of the world‚Äôs master chef at his best, was so disappointing, he should be sent packing from wherever he came from.  Please do not attempt visiting this restaurant."
994,We had a terrific stay at the JW Marriott Juhu recently. The hotel has a great feel to it and the staff makes it really special. I would especially like to call out Vini and the Front Office team who were really courteous and efficient in terms of taking care of our requirements. An evening at Deshanzi is a must with Rameez playing the perfect host. The hotel is at a great location and perfectly suited for both business and leisure. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great experience in Mumbai.
995,"My parents and I have spent a week in the Royal Lotus Suite, and this is our second stay at this hotel. There are so many things to praise here -- the hotel landscape, while small in keeping with the real estate constraints of Mumbai, is beautifully designed; the pool is the largest and most beautiful hotel pool I have used and they have complimentary iced lemon water and cucumber water available poolside; the food and beverage offerings at the executive lounge are varied and delicious; the food at their Chinese restaurant (which also offers sushi) Dashanzi is exceptional. The service is, for the most part, very warm; I would specially like to thank Kenny, Rupesh, Pravin, and Leah from the spa area, and Parasnath from housekeeping for genuinely making us feel like no request was"
996,Located across  the beach and only 30 min away from the international airport ( no traffic ) it is an island of peace inside chaotic Mumbai. Price it is a bit on the high side for local standards but nothing compared to what you would pay in the US.  Breakfast buffet is amazing
997,"This is one of the best five star hotels in the city. Very luxurious and top notch. For such an expensive hotel, i found it surprising that the property asked for almost 800 bucks for one day internet! Hostels and smaller hotels are offering it free of cost these days in India and across the world!! That was a weird for me. Else no particular complaints!"
998,"It was great time spent at jw Marriott .the staff was very hospitalise and courteous.the food was mouth watering and I never had this kind of food which was full of local speciality .it was great breakfast at jw cafe served by Ashutosh with extra care by dinesh,Mukesh.chandan and ranjit at trout were superb.chef Kalam also took very care of us."
999,"I stayed for two days in this hotel, location is perfect, on the beach..you can actually watch sea while having breakfast..it has all the amenities which anyone look forward to in any 5 star hotel. though its on expensive side..  overall strongly recommend to stay with family & friends ..will definitely plan to visit again.."
1000,"I visit Mumbai 1-2 times per year on business and won't stay anywhere else.  This time felt most special as we were taken care of so well.   This time round I needed a few rooms, Vini (Front Office Manager) took great care of us from booking to arrival.  She even came to welcome me personally on arrival and follow up to make sure everything was ok.   Room was on 5th floor. Even though it was a smoking room, there wasn't the faintest smell of smoke and had a great view of the pool, beach and beyond (see photo).   Room itself (554) was spacious and on a corner, allowing more space. Had walk in wardrobe, bath with separate shower and fabulous spacious room. The room was also spotless and I received great service from my housekeeper, I am sure his name was Kunal.   We dined in the"
1001,"I had an erroneous charge made on my corporate credit card after I checked out. I called the hotel a total of 8-10 times over 2 days to discuss this and sort out the problem. All of the calls were international calls since I am not based in India. Each time I was put on hold indefinitely and then told that the duty manager's line was busy and he was unavailable. Each time I painstakingly gave the details of my reservation number, date of check in and check out, name and contact number and requested for the duty manager to call me back. Over a period of 48 hours, nobody from the hotel bothered to get back in touch with me.   I am a Marriott Elite member and I am absolutely shocked at this poor level of customer service. I have not encountered this level of service at any business"
1002,Awesome spread so many types of food. Fun safe but expensive. India idli‚Äôs and somber great. Eggs and fresh juices. Had a delicious croissant. Our stay in Mumbai has been fun reconnecting with family. Seeing the city newly. For first time on my third trip! Lol Don‚Äôt forget India is famous for service. Read about our trip to Udipur.
1003,"Huge sprawling property, very well maintained adjacent to a water body. Rooms are well furnished and the service professional.Wide range of food available.  Has quite a few  conference venues of varying sizes with lots of breakout areas."
1004,I recently sent an email to JW to their India Reservations team stating I need 4 rooms for 2 adults and a kid. The team booked me on a single occupancy room. After an email to the team for a change in name and the occupancy they came back with a name change but no change on the occupancy. So i called the reservations team and asked them to do they necessary changes. Offer quoted was 9k plus taxes. The lady did the change but did not inform me that the price is now 12.5k plus taxes. When i checked online i saw the new price so i asked to speak to guy who did the booking. I was extremely polite and asked him why did it go wrong in the first place and why did he not change the occupancy on my email and update me of the new price. Was i to get this surprise on my check in? How
1005,I recently travelled to Mumbai for a work trip.   I work American hours while I am here (evening and nights) so in the daytime  I spent a lot of time at the 4th floor Executive lounge.  The service and attention there was excellent by all the staff.  But 2 in particular went out of their way to make me feel welcome and as comfortable as possible.  Ivan and Shahabas!  They were both every attentive to my every need making sure I had all I needed to get my work done.  They ensures I had a drink if needed and food even and a clean place to sit at my favorite table!   They are both excellent and I wanted to say thank you to both of them.   I am looking forward to my next trip and seeing them again!
1006,"We stayed there for 3 days.Everthing was good.Great services!! Buffet menu was awesome.Near Airport.The room had enough space with very classic interior.Home theater was also available for good mood.                   !!Must recommended!!                            "" Lovely Place"""
1007,"If ever you want a bit of solace from the hustling roads of Juhu drop in here. The hotel is huge, something you cant make out from outside. The flip side stays that you keep walking from one end to another (for all those who hate to walk). The variety over the meals needs to be tasted. The scenic pool overlooks the Arabian sea. The service, however, takes a bit of a time -- maybe as mentioned above, walking from one end to the other takes a bit of time."
1008,"JW Marriott, one of the best hotels in Juhu, Mumbai. the stay was awesome as per my opinion. I loved it very much. The reception was awesome. the food was very good. the room service was all good. Nice stay."
1009,"First, the service in this hotel is excellent. This is as one would expect in an expensive Marriott property. The high service level is evident in the F&B outlets, housekeeping, room service and conferencing. Second, the food here is as good as I‚Äôve eaten. The breakfast and lunch buffets are sumptuous and the Saffron Indian restaurant is particularly good. The staff invited us into the kitchen where we helped in the cooking of our roti and murgh dishes! This was great fun and a sign of the confidence of the chefs in what they‚Äôre doing. Third, I attended a conference in the hotel during the week and all staff with whom I engaged in this context were most helpful and responsive. Finally - and alas in a somewhat more negative tenor - I found the front desk staff less than helpful"
1010,A stunningly spacious and beautifully decorated property which is a refreshing contrast to the hustle and bustle of the outside city. Our stay was made all the more special due to the staff in all areas who remember your smallest idiosyncrasies to make sure your stay is tailor made and just the way you like it - from how you like your tea to what sauce you like with your omelette they have it all ready before you even ask. Special thanks to house keeping and the amazing boys at the Lotus Cafe during breakfast hours!!!
1011,I put up myself at JW Marriot Juhu to meet a friend who had come from London. I got a room which had a vew to the Juhu beach and the staff was very friendly and helping.. A night's stay whether to meet a friend or business trip is worth here. Next time I plan to stay couple of days to experience this hotel fully.
1012,"Amazing ambiance, pool party, guest appearance is truely the best part of this place. Having a lot of Indore outdoor games, different party nights at weekdays and weekends are an added advantage. Happy"
1013,"like above amazing hotel, but not upto to scratch for a 5 * hotel, when you ask for a cup of tea, you wait 5/10 min for milk and then another 5 min for sugar. people are lovely but inefficient. you also have to ask for things 3/4 times before it arrives.  I would stay there again but they do need to act upon customer services!"
1014,"What a wonderful hotel!  Amidst a busy and complicated business trip, this JW Marriott location was a welcome peaceful home away from home.  While I don't normally avail myself of hotel's spa services, the ayurvedic massage from Rupesh in the Quan spa was spectacular."
1015,I stayed at this lovely property in January 2014 and it was simply amazing. The premier club rooms on the 5th floor facing the beach are breath taking and worth every penny. The lounge benefits received complimentary with this room is simply amazing. Do stay at this hotel! you will have a great stay
1016,I mailed at 8 pm to guest relations with my request for a room for the same night. All my preferences were perfectly arranged by Ms. Samantha Pereira within 1 hr. I was pleasantly surprised with the birthday cake in my room the next morning. Later that day Mr. Ivan Sen was very helpful with my logistics needs. I truly believe the staff is really guest oriented. This is my second visit in 1 month and they always gave me that special feeling. Very much appreciated. Thank you very much!!
1017,"Hotel is located next to airport. They pickup and drop off . You can also use their excellent limousine service for any trip, including WiFi ! Rooms are spacious , well designed and fine layout , great bed and excellent shower. Service is impeccable. Breakfast buffet and diner buffet extensive. Best Italian restaurant in town is in this hotel.  Weak point is outside areas , while bar and lobby are not very ‚Äòcosy‚Äô."
1018,"I checked-in on 7-Nov and checked-out on 10-Nov at JW Marriott Juhu for a business trip. It's great experience overall. Reception upgraded me to the beach facing room, took care of my requests like Yoga mat in the room.  Breakface buffet spread is nice and good quality. That area is again beach facing. I could enter the Juhu beach from hotel's back door and reenter with full sucurity enabled.  I look forward to many more stays!"
1019,"We stayed in the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu for one night, it was excellent. Our trip took us from Bangalore to Pune and then onto Mumbai.  Having stayed at the Marriott in Pune, I was hoping this hotel would be a true 5 Star and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.  The hotel picked us up from the airport and whilst Mumbai traffic was crazy, on arrival to the hotel the check in was effortless.  The rooms were very comfortable and the stay were excellent.  Front of House Staff were excellent and Reshma was particularly pleasant and very helpful.  For dinner we ate in the Italian restaurant for a change. Food, service and wine were very good but the best thing about this hotel has to be the buffet.    We had breakfast the following morning and they put on every possible cuisine.  It would be worth"
1020,"This is supposedly the hangout of Bollywood bigwigs, but nevertheless a very nice and luxurious property. Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful, especially those in the Executive Lounge. A huge array of cuisines during the breakfast buffet, and a choice of restaurants for the other meals.  The location on the Juhu Beach does not mean you should plan to swim - that is a huge no, just enjoy the hotel pools."
1021,"Lost its sheen! Inconsistent service, poor staff interactions, least bothered to rude folks, managerial staff did not know their own hotel, poor quality of two pieces of fruit in the room ... quite a unexpected experience from one of my favourite hotels."
1022,Obviously one of the best hotel to stay in Mumbai. Great Ambiance and good food. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Ideal for family trip as well as business trip. Staff is very supportive. No complains.
1023,"Visited JW marriott Juhu for a meeting , the place was buzzing as usual . The natural lights all over due to usage of glass walls , give a positive vibe to the place . Very high profile guests are always seen around in the hotel . The banquet hall was well set for the event and well handled by a trained set of team who are always there to serve you or assist you with any requirement . The food was excellent , south Indian theme and well planned menu , covering all the states . The hotel seemed  full too . The view from the hotel lobby or coffee shop to the pool side or the beach side has always been the USP of the hotel . The only draw back would be the traffic jam outside the hotel during extended peak hours . Would strongly recommend it is a must visit hotel when in mumbai"
1024,"We have stayed at this hotel number of times and as always, it was a very comfortable stay.  During this trip, we stayed for 3 nights between 3rd and 6th November.  We had two rooms booked - 166 and 168.    Normally, I do not write reviews but this time I am doing so due to the exceptional service received by Sean (in housekeeping) and Dhiraj (in Revolutions bar).  Both were extremely professional, friendly and always went over and above to meet all our requests so I specifically wanted to highlight their great service and is the main purpose of writing this review.  However, this is does not mean that other staff were not friendly - everyone at the hotel is highly professional and try their very best at all times to make guests staff comfortable and exceed expectation.  Food in"
1025,"Beautiful location and pools. I like doing my work outside, and this offered me a great place to do that, as long as I had shade. But watch out, there's no alcohol allowed outside. The staff had to be the friendliest and most helpful staff I've ever had at a Marriott, and I'm a rewards member. Rooms were clean and orderly. I have nothing to complain about."
1026,"I had a horrible experience at J W Marriott in December 2016. It was nice to see that the team more than made up for it on this visit. The team in the Executive lounge are lovely.   The location has always been a bonus for me as the hotel is close to a lot of places for shopping, meetings etc.   It was also nice to encounter a more dynamic front of house team this time round. For me great service is at the heart of my travels and I truly believe that this time good service is exactly what I got. I look forward to returning soon :)"
1027,"Jwcafe is greatüëåand room are nice, sadly i don‚Äôt get smoking room so my suggestion is please add more smoking rooms ‚úåÔ∏èüòÇ After few days in Mumbai I think this is the best place around the airport üëåüòé"
1028,Amazing hotel with the most attentive staff I have seen in a long time. Everything was flawless and I can only recommend this hotel. Especially I was very impressed with the quality of the room and the efforts put in by the staff to make my stay special.
1029,"We were travelling with a 10 Month baby and they have been so accommodating. They did fresh baby food on demand, warm it round the clock , give us everything we need to be sure that we were confortable with the baby.  The swimming pool is great and enjoyable at the end of a busy day. The food delicious and a lot of choices in the buffet. The rooms have everything you will expect from this category.  I would definitely recommend the place and will come back!"
1030,Really good stay here. Staff are amazing. Special thank to Saif and Jigyasa at the reception. They were really helpful and check in was great - upgraded us to a room with a better view. Very clean facility. Breakfast was amazing with lots of variety and vegetarian options. Excellent gym and although we did not get a chance to use pool area it looked really good.
1031,"The property is old, but the rooms are nicely revamped. Nice. The best part is the legendary service provided to its guests. Somehow, they are able to remember who you are. I am addressed my name (even though I am an ordinary member of the Marriott program). How they do this is beyond me. It goes to show the dedication in their service. At breakfast when dining alone, the service staff frequently comes over to ask how they can assist further. I have never felt so ‚Äòpampered‚Äô in my life. Indeed the service level is legendary. They are doing everything right at JW Marriott Juhu. Kudos, I will definitely be back here!"
1032,"My daughter and I stayed a week from 22 October and we were so happy that we  chose this hotel.  The staff are just so wonderful there.  Chefs Mr Mehta and Mr Nishad fed us wonderful dishes and were only to eager to please us.  Rupesh from Lotus Caf√© served us daily with a smile.  Ms Swati made our checkout very easy, efficient and painless.  I have to mention Michael from the executive lounge who excelled in customer service.  Nothing was difficult for him to handle.  He was just exceptional.  Thank you.  Definitely will return to this hotel."
1033,I have been here for team dinner. The infrastructure is good. Great hospitality. Not a place if you are fond of Indian food however you get almost all other type of cuisines. Delicious fruits and deserts add charm to the beautiful ambience
1034,"I have stayed at this hotel several times on professional trips and those stays were many years back. I remember that even then this hotel was well managed and an excellent place to stay. I stayed in this hotel now after a long gap and that too with my family (though only for one night). It was a delight to find the hotel as good as before! Hotel lobby and surrounding area are exceptional and one feels openness as distinct advantage of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed and many rooms have excellent views of the sea. Service and hospitality in the hotel is remarkable.  Lotus Cafe is picturesque with beautiful views. Breakfast is truly a treat. Several varieties, good choice of food items, and personalised service. Restaurant managers, chefs, and sous chef make it a point to"
1035,"We spend a night at The JW Marriott Juhu.... it was amazing... thanks for the service, the kindness, the beautiful Suite. The breakfast was delicious, the location it‚Äôs perfect. Highly recommend. Look forward to come back."
1036,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff was friendly and professional, and the lobby and grounds were well-maintained as was my room. What really stood out was the quality of the service. The food in the lounge was very good and the staff was a pleasure to interact with.  My wife needed to depart early and Phub helped us with phone calls to airlines and later assisted us with a package that was being delivered from another hotel. Samantha, the Guest Relations Manager, helped us locate the wayward package while Phub was off duty."
1037,"A home away from home  Excellent location in the heart of the city, and most importantly near to the airport. The staff at the entrance of the hotel were very welcoming, especially at the reception. A big thank you to Ms Jhanavi who let us access our rooms straight away instead of having to wait till the official check-in time and she very kindly allowed us a complimentary breakfast.  Rooms are very comfortable. Food especially the buffet breakfast, OMG !! Wow, it is so largely spread‚Ä¶  Even being pure vegetarian you will multiple options to choose like south indian, poha, puri bhaaji, bhaaji-pav, chole puri, fruits, eggless breads, etc‚Ä¶ And still the Sous Chef Mr Dvipal Mehta came especially to us asking us if we would like to have something out of the menu, Man, what can be"
1038,"My first time to India and what a great way to spend it by relaxing at the JW Marriott At Juhu Beach.   From the moment I stepped out of the cab there was professional and attentive service and so many nice folks there to help me check in. The gentleman that finally checked me I. Personally walked me to my room and gave me the rundown on the entire facility and answered all my questions.   The room was perfect, a beautiful king room overlooking the pool area and beach. The perfect selection of mini bar items and always service standing by 24hrs per day   Breakfast the next morning in the Coffee Shop was amazing! So many amazing choices I am glad I have a few more days to try everything.   The hotel offers so many choices for restaurants and shops and services; I doubt I‚Äôll make"
1039,It was an excellent place to enjoy with family. only that the rooms maintenance team are not detailed enough to their jobs. They need to put in some little more efforts on the job.  The SPA team was awesome I did enjoy their service to me and my family. Kudos to the team leader for her efforts in ensuring that her team members are collaborating together.  Thanks  Okeke
1040,Beautiful is not the word that can describe this property. Live in the lap of luxury. The d√©cor the service the rooms and the entire property itself are all a class apart. Loved this place even compared to the US property.
1041,"This is a very beautiful hotel...royal & grand. And the property is spread out vast. The furniture, upholstery and everything about this hotel is top quality. The breakfast buffet was a huge spread and was very appetizing. The pool is of a huge length and segregated in 3 parts. One can easily spend your evening around the pool and the garden area. The staff was very helpful and attentive."
1042,"This is probably one of the best hotel I have ever visited, fancy rooms with beautiful view of the sea, very well trained staffs and topping all that is the delicious food. What separate JW Marriott from others is the visiting of celebrities to this place as the hotel is perfectly located in the heart of juhu. Great Job!"
1043,"This acknowledges wonderful staff and superb hospitality accorded to us during two visits to J W Marriott in Juhu.  We stayed at the hotel first from 21st of September 2017 to 24th of September 2017 and second time on October 10, 2017.    The hotel service is best judged when the staff comes through crisis for the guest which we encountered during our visit in September.  The monsoon rains in Mumbai had resulted in the diversion of our flight to Delhi with subsequent mishandling of the bags.  The hotel team comprising of Pascal at the front desk, Ivan in the Executive Lounge, Jigyasa Nigam, the Front Desk Manager, Sunil Kadam and Mr. Pias from Airport Services, and Akshaya Pratap Dixit went immediately into action and worked continuously for two days to trace our bags, to"
1044,"I and my husband came to the hotel for a dinner at lotus cafe it was our 1st wedding anniversary, Tanvi came to know that, so she got a beautiful  pastry it was so heart touching, It was a memorable experience being at the Lotus cafe. Thank you for such a beautiful service."
1045,"After my recent visit I came to realise that I had recently visited the most popular,  most enticing and most acknowledged hotel of Mumbai. J. W. Marriott is surely a benchmark for hotel industry.  The multi cuisine buffet,  the serenity  of the pools surrounded by lush green plants,  the resplendent view of the juhu beach having romance with the day and night weather added a cherry on the cake of a spacious well furnished executive rooms.  Though being a brand I expected a lot more warmth and hospitality but then a brand is known to be explicit not repetitive.  Perks of living here is that u constantly get a chance to meet various Indian celebs of bollywood, sports and if u are lucky then you can witness variety of exciting events.( I was lucky enough to enjoy dry fruits and"
1046,"One of the best decisions we made for our trip to Mumbai was to stay at this magnificient hotel The pick up at the airport was very efficient with a very pleasant chauffer . The staff at the entrance of the hotel were very welcoming and efficient. The check in was flawless and the room was well prepared. Clean and welcoming! Ample space, clean and neat bathroom, lots of aamenities, comfortable mattress and pillows. Our room boy Santosh went out of his way to make sure every thing was perfect in the room, every day. Every staff member was very couteous and polite. The food OMG! amazing especially the breakfasst spread. There was everything and I mean everything available . There was English breakfast, Continental, Far eastern, Indian, fruits, juices, coffee tea includng masala"
1047,"The Marriott has a reputation for being par excellence in hospitality and it lives up to those standards,occasionally slipping up.  We generally stay at the Taj but decided to give this a try for our Anniversary.  I'll try and do something different here. Instead of reviewing our experience of the hotel in isolation, I'll compare it with it's competitors. That way travellers can make more informed decisions of which luxury hotel they'd rather go to in Mumbai.  Let's start with checking in. The Taj Lands End has the most warm & hospitable check-in as compared to The Grand Hyatt or JW Marriott (Juhu). Guests are seated comfortably and can talk details with their attendant while completing check in formalities. The garlanding lends a nice ethnic welcome touch to things.  Having"
1048,"We visited Safaron restaurant with family and had a great time. Both ambience and food were awesome. Manager Mr Vivek made our visit memorable , seemed like home . Must visit for all good lovers. Happy Diwali to Safaron staff."
1049,"Had a fabulous dinner at this place. Very nice service by Babu , who attended on us. He was very cordial , soft and served us with lots of respect . Must visit this restaurant...... great ambience and very cordial people who make u feel very comfortable."
1050,"I've stayed at the JW Marriott in Mumbai about 20 times and have never had anything but exceptional experiences.  The Staff is always on their game.  The hotel is immaculate and the security is exceptional.  There is nothing about the hotel that is not outstanding.  The Executive Lounge Staff could not be friendlier or more helpful.  They all go out of their way to meet your every need.  Ivan and Michael are just amazing.  And when it comes to Customer Service, Phub is the best."
1051,"This hotel has one of the best locations in Mumbai. It s a hotel on the beach.  The hotel is grand, with a beautiful pool facing the beach which is nice and green.  The fitness center is also very nice and they have many restaurants, all serving good food.  I highly recommend."
1052,"An excellent hotel in the heart of the city, very near to the airport. The Juhu beach is adjoining the hotel and can be very relaxing. A sea facing room like the one I had is very nice. Nicely maintained hotel, excellent food and courteous staff makes the experience even better. The access roads can get difficult at peak hours and during rainy seasons. One needs to get the time right otherwise getting on to the Western Expressway can be a big challenge. There are all types of restaurants in the vicinity catering to various needs.  Very large infinity swimming pool, with gym, spa and open spaces for guests to enjoy the outside."
1053,"The best thing about this hotel is probably its location. Its almost on the beach. I think the hotel is designed in such a way that most of the rooms have an excellent view of the beach and the sea. There is a small backdoor through which one can go on to the beach. However while the beach looks great from the hotel room, but I was a bit disappointed as it was not as clean as i had expected. Since its a public beach it is a bit crowded in the mornings. The hotel is overall great and has all modern amenities as expected from a luxury hotel. Morning breakfast has a fair variety of both Indian and continental menu.Hospitality is good. However there are a few things which I think can be improved: 1. The names of halls/meeting rooms etc are a bit unsual and takes some time to learn."
1054,The stay at JW Marriott Juhu is stands apart from others.  The exotic view of beautiful beach and beach access is really commendable.  The most attractive place is their fitness centre and spa. The multi cuisine restaurant will provide all most all the foods in the world.  Nothing more to say.  The stay at Marriott is simply the Best.
1055,It's one of the many hotels located in Juhu area. It is easily accessible from Mumbai airport by a cab. It's a great 5 star hotel and serves lovely buffet dinner at its restaurants. The location provides easy access to the juhu beach and other suburban areas of the town. Must Try - Lotus Cafe - This place serves you with an amazing menu for their buffet! The view that accompanies you on your fine dine experience is breathtaking! The food is delicious! They offer you with a variety of cuisines to choose from! The range of dessert is will for sure provide you with a happy ending! It‚Äôs a must visit!
1056,J w marriott is one of the many hotels located in juhu area. It is easily accessible from Mumbai airport by a cab. It's a great 5 star hotel and serves lovely buffet dinner at its restaurants. The location provides easy access to the juhu beach and other suburban areas of the town.
1057,The breakfast is the best I have ever had anywhere. If you want to eat the best North Indian food must go to Saffron restaurant. All the staff was exceptionally polite. The campus is bang on the beach and the pool and the fish pond are beautifully placed.
1058,The property is blessed with amazingly courteous team..  Right thru checkin to checkout.. you are attended with courteous team..  Room was spacious and clean..tastefully decorated..good linen..washroom well equipped..  More so do not miss the beach...evening sunset and early morning strolls...  Rooms have beach view..albeit a limited view...still great to have the vision of ocean..  Restaurants - - Many....  Do not miss the lotus buffet spread....unlimited choice to spoil your taste buds..  Saffron -- taste of true Indian delicacy..  Do not miss the array of sandwiches at the cafe...freshly baked breads...and choice of oven cooked stuffings...and the Chai varieties..  True Luxury Hotel..have a dip in the pool....well equipped gym with friendly trainers around..  Very
1059,I stayed in this hotel for one night at I was passing through Mumbai.   Rooms are clean and nice.  The spa is amazing  I only eat halal meat so I was a little reluctant to eat the chicken and beef in the restaurant after being advised it is halal.  My problem was the restaurant also served non halal meats   Other than this the hotel was great   Location is about 15 mins from airport by car
1060,We went there for a staycation with our under 1 twins and must admit it was amazing! Very kid friendly staff and hotel! Special mention for the staff at lotus cafe who took care of our dinner preferences so well! The manager was extremely polite and went out of his way to make our dining experience memorable with our 2 little ones!!! Will go there again for sure very soon!
1061,The experience was good at the lotus cafe  The staff komal pal she was good to help she has an excellent service and had cool and cam respone with the customer and she ready to help It was good experience to have a time in lotus cafe.
1062,"we stayed at this hotel three weeks ago for one week..  The breakfast buffet was great with many choices.  The room we booked was for ocean view but to our disappointment,the room they gave was a small corner room. They said that the room was an upgrade (club room).    When we checked into the room it certainly was not an upgrade and it was all the way in the corner with no view.  I was unhappy and after talking to the receptionist they moved us to a room with somewhat ocean view.  Thats not what I expect from Marriott, as I am a Marriott member."
1063,"Our stay was a memorable one. Even the executive lounge was awesome. All rooms are ocean view. However, do not try to go to the beach. The beach is very dirty. Spend time inside the hotel . Its worthwhile"
1064,"A wonderful cozy hotel with  rooms with a view we were lucky to get one facing the Juhu beach overlooking the pools.The room service was excellent and cleanliness maintained to the highest level.Only thing was our room from the lifts was the farthest one ,a good walk to the room.They need to renovate the lobby carpets of floors .One of the top luxury hotel if you want to live on the beach."
1065,This hotel is one of the best luxury hotels in Mumbai . It‚Äôs located on the Juhu beach . We had an business meeting here and we stayed here for 2 nights and it‚Äôs really amazing. Rooms are superb with sea view rooms . Nightlife here is really awesome and you can see many Bollywood stars here during parties . We enjoyed this place a lot and direct connectivity to beach .this place is worth it
1066,"Visited this place with friends. Being a worldwide traveler, this place is one which gives a taste of authentic food of original place. Had awesome chicken Rengdan with steam jasmine rice and Braised pork belly, sugar snap, assorted mushroom.   Icing on the cake was ballon chocolate burst actually called as Freezing chocolate balloon. Must must have  highly recommended dessert.  Just enjoyed our evening.    Would like to give special thanks to Chef Nishad Sebastian for wonderful hospitality. He is not only thorough with food and style but has amazing hospitality skills and great knowledge of worldwide food.  He is truely marriottrian chef. Thanks to Chefs Saurab/Tanuj/sagar Moore and  Mr Benson for wonderful welcoming.   10/10 place for this evening place."
1067,"As I always say, it is not only the property but the people that maketh the place for what it is.  This was probably one of my best stays in India. If there was a 6-star rating on tripadvisor, then this is one hotel that certainly deserves it. The rooms are brilliant, the buffet breakfast splendid, the evening snacks in the lounge amazing with a fantastic view. It is indeed home away from home and they really cater to almost all your needs. Their service is indeed genuine and they make you feel welcomed. Certainly more than worth the price you pay for.  From the bottom of my heart I would like to thank the hotel management and the fantastic team for such a memorable stay. So here goes, Michael and Ivan from the 4th floor lounge thank you guys for being so so sweet. Luis from the"
1068,The indian restaurant - excellent service levels and well trained ushers and servers.  The staff were in the capacity to suggest menus and enhanced sales for the hotel by ensuring they recomended the signature dishes of the chef.
1069,All these years since it's inception he Marriott continues to extend and surpass all benchmarks of superior hospitality.do try the lotus cafe buffet and take a stroll and admire the beautiful interiors.its Luxury is simply unmatchable
1070,"I'd just spent nearly 20 hours commuting from NYC only to get thrown right into the infamous Mumbai traffic. It was late, I was beat, and everything was hot and sticky. People and rickshaws everywhere. Wow. Ugh, are we there yet? I didn't book this hotel. My company did. But if you've read my prior reviews, I can pretty much deal with any hotel situation. When our car arrives at the JWM, we got security checked like we were visiting the White House. Should I be worried? The car pulls up the hill and we are greeted by exceptionally polite and well-groomed front-area staff. We brisk through another layer of security with metal detectors - OK, now I'm worried - and into a grand lobby overlooking a garden, pool, and beyond that, Juhu Beach. Ahhhh! Cool air. What's this? Watermelon"
1071,"Stayed for 3 nights for a business trip in Mumbai, what a great stay we have. The hotel seems bit outdated but well maintained. being a gold member, I was well recognized and got a room upgrade to an ocean view suite.....very nice touch...executive lounge was nice and special thanks to Mr. Michael Gunnell for his heart and very friendly reception! he made us really comfortable during our stay, his dedicate service should be well recognized by the hotel management. I even got a free ride back to the airport pleasantly as a gold memebr...what a surprise and nice touch again!  lack of restaurants choice inside of the hotel was bit odd but overall the stay was very good and will return next time I visit Mumbai."
1072,Amazing food and ambience at SAFFRON restaurant !!! Try the tomato shorba and dahi kebab tikki . Kulfi is a must try . Rahul & team were perfect hosts  üñí we are looking forward for our next visit. Hopefully very soon üòä
1073,"It's ideally located on the beach and has direct access to the beach from the pool side. The grounds and hotel itself is beautiful! I loved the pool area... so many options from a quiet private area to the open pool.... fab.   The breakfast is fantastic with live music playing in the background.   One of the chefs, Dvipal Mehta, met with us and he was accommodating to my requirements (I wanted a specific smoothie and I had food intolerances); made me feel very comfortable.   Unfortunately, I was not very well and had to cut my visit short. The hotel were courteous enough not to penalise me and infact extended my check out time to ensure my comfort.   A big thank you to Vanya, from the front desk, who went out of her way to help me out."
1074,"The director of Quan spa Gunjan Lakhani , Therapist Mayofi were excellent in their job. Gunjan is very attentive in the providing best services to the patrons in Quan spa.

1075,"I'll be straight and to the point. I found Mumbai to be a very crowded and not so clean city. However, inside the walls of the JW Marriott in Juhu I felt very safe, welcomed, comfortable and almost at home. The staff at the JW in Juhu seemed to be very happy to work there and pleasing their guests came naturally.  The property itself was very impressive, with a central pool with multiple areas for adults and children. The beach was accessible through a large gate in the wall surrounding the property.  The food at the JW was outstanding. I stayed for 3 hours at the lunch Buffett and still didnt try everything. At lunch tho I was fortunate enough to meet the head chef Nishad. When Nishad learned it was my birthday he invited me to Dsa.Za.Hni for dinner.  The sushi was great, there"
1076,"We stayed for a week and from our room we could see the sun set. Great service and the staff were very friendly and helpful, always there to help. Especially Nishad Sebastian (Chef de Cuisine), arranged for a cookery session, Ganesh Vesarjan. Food is excellent in Saffron, Dabhanzi and in the executive lounge. Would recommend to book executive rooms and the experience is amazing."
1077,Great service and ambience for a relaxed luxurious stay.  Lotus cafe extends the gastronomic experience with a large spread for a great multi cuisine option to please every palate. A super overall experience with the class of JWM
1078,"Located at Juhu beach, the property is sprawling and gorgeous with top notch amenities including a killer breakfast spread with one of the best waffles, cold coffee and cold cuts. Over looking the sea, they have one private door which opens directly on the beach - what more could be asked for.  The rooms are spacious, with huge windows, work stations and roomy cupboards. The best part is their executive lounge where they offer delicious tidbits through out the day - a great place to unwind post a day of sight seeing or just working through the day.  The pool area is the hot spot to sun bathe, swim and soak in the serene vibes.  The staff is courteous and ensures you have an exemplary experience"
1079,"I stayed for a week with work.  From my room you could see the sea.  I was disappointed that despite the latch I could not open my window even with a safety catch.  My room was well set up, great bathroom and sliding doors for privacy.  Lifting was complicated and frustrating to turn off or tune down to one light at night as they were set up in sets. My room was a 108m walk from nearest life, with no stairs access ( unless in emergency) this made for lots of walking to and from the lift.  I felt a bit entrapped. Gardens, pools and gym were well set up and maintained.  Restaurants served a variety of food to a high standard.  We ate both in a Mezzo the Italian restaurant and Japanese.  Staff were very professional and diligent and food was of high quality. I wasn't a fan of the"
1080,Excellent JW property. Good sized rooms which appear to have been updated. Solid executive lounge with a great happy hour and breakfast. More than anything the staff was top notch. Pool area was outstanding but Juhu beach was a huge disappointment. Extremely dirty and hotel staff recommended not to touch water. Seems about right.
1081,"It is ideally located hotel in Mumbai. Close to airport. You can walk down to world famous juhu chaupati. Swimming pool is awesome,it appears as if you are lying in Sea. Food is great. Musicians sitting for live music are amazing. Wonderful experience."
1082,"I am a platinum member of Marriott so going into this hotel I had the normal platinum expectations.  However, since it was my first trip to India I had to step aside my normal expectations.  This hotel was amazing.  More importantly, the soft product was the best I have ever experienced at a Marriott.  The people here are stellar.  Pavithran Nambiar you need to be proud of your staff as they addressed every need that I had and went far above the service level I had expected.  I will recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mumbai.  Thank you!  First, the location.  For those that want to be in the bustle of downtown - this is not the hotel for you.  I chose it because it was on the beach and I wanted a retreat from the hustle of a downtown.  I was able to get to the downtown"
1083,"Much overdue review. The JW Marriott in Juhu really exceeded my expectations. The hotel is a piece of sanity in a chaotic city. The service is what sets this hotel aside. Everyone from the bellhop to the front dest, to housekeeping are very well in tune to the customers needs. I traveled solo with my 2 children, and felt very safe and comfortable my entire stay. The airport transfers are a travelers delight after a 15 hour flight. I used the gym everyday of my stay, and had a few sessions with Shekhar, who was outstanding. Special shout out to Mike and I think Shreya in the executive lounge. Please Don't not miss breakfast or the Sunday Brunch, both are delicious with almost to much variety. We will definitely be returning. Thanks for a lovely stay."
1084,"Excellent place to stay with lovely ambiance breakfast was mindboggling with variety of food had dinner at saffron restaurant, was amazing - awadhi food at its best room was small and not spacious enough floor was noisy during the morning hours all in all a lovely stay"
1085,"Spent three nights s lovely property on Juhu beach. Everything is first class but the best part of it was the service from the staff in the executive lounge.  They couldn't do enough for us. My first night there i met Nishad, the chef.  He asked if he could make something for me and continued to check every time he Saw me if I needed anything to eat.  Michael took care of us throughout.  All the staff were super attentive.  My room was lovely. There's the inevitable musty smell which I didn't notice except for the first day.  I had a large room facing the beach and overlooking the pool.  If I return to Mumbai this is where I will stay.  I can't wait to see the staff again."
1086,I stay here every time I'm in Mumbai. I usually stay here for 2-3 days to shop in Mumbai before heading out to Gujarat. It's close to the Santa Cruz area which is popular to shop at. They're car service picks my family and I up from the airport and help us with our luggage. They have amazing service! The hotel has amazing breakfast as well! Their rooms are comfortable and clean. I would 100% recommend staying here!
1087,"We stayed here for three nights, checked in on Friday and checked out on Monday. A comfortable, spacious and luxurious property. The room was comfortable, we really liked the buffet spread at cafe lotus for breakfast as well as dinner. I tried the spa and loved itüòä A special mention for Ms Jigyasa, the front desk manager, she was very helpful .  The only drawback, and one the hotel cannot control is the smell from the beach on rainy evenings.... Otherwise a comfortable stay."
1088,"This was a very busy hotel with a lot going on. The best time was breakfast time. There was a lot of choice. My only complaint would be that young children were allowed to run riot in the dining room and also dipping their fingers in different foods. I felt that this was not appropriate. But otherwise, the facilities were excellent. They had 3 swimming pools which was also great. Though I would not recommend going on the beach!!"
1089,"I have stayed here multiple times and each time I leave happy, satisfied and content.  I am absolutely in love with the professional and super-accommodating staff team of JW. Everything from front desk to Pool, Room to the restaurant, Spa to fitness centre is just perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed indian classical in the morning and was delighted when the artist catered my personal request :) Appreciate the gesture..  It is unarguably one of my favourite properties in Bombay.  Love it.."
1090,First time in Mumbai and this hotel is an oasis of calm in the middle of all the mayhem. Clean and spacious from the moment you walk in you get treated almost too good! Staff are very attentive and they really care about your stay and comfort. Perfect choice for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the outside world.  Food also is excellent great breakfast served by people who aim to please.  Great hotel!
1091,"5 stays in the past 12 months, so I consider this a ""third"" home, after USA, Mexico, and now the JW Juhu... As always the staff are super friendly and helpful!  Love the staff in the lounge, and Sam who has moved on to Guest Relations downstairs, and the executive chef, always offering to cook a dish!  See you guys in Oct!  another 10 days!!!"
1092,"Stayed at this hotel with family, had 2 rooms, the minute you walk in you are treated really nicely. We got there a bit early so got offered masala tea which we really appreciated. We got one room to rest in till our rooms got ready so they gave us an early check in on one of the rooms. Which we were grateful for. The breakfast was one of the best I had. We had tried their dinner one night too. Which was nice bit expensive but was nice. I would recommend going to a restaurant called mahesh round the corner for sea food. That was amazing! No complains about this hotel. Highly recommend."
1093,"As I scribe my most amazing experiences of my stay in JW Marriott, I can already feel the excitement brewing up in me to plan my next visit soon. This is the impact of the unforgettable exquisite hospitality showered on me!  Where do I begin? From the personal greeting at the airport, to being delivered to either an awaiting town car, or I was treated like royalty BY MY MOST FAVOURITE Chef Mr. Nishad Sebastian, and the staff in the hotel, they just knew everything about my needs. Upon my arrival, I was so much taken by surprise and was over-whelmed when I entered my room and saw a white dish with a hand written, welcome message for me, from Chef Nishad and some sweet goodies alongside it! It meant a lot and I almost felt, at home! This doesn‚Äôt end here, I was spoilt with a"
1094,"A name to be reckon with, the hotel is very conveniently located at Juhu. The ambience is perfect for business as well as leisure trips. The rooms are cosy & the beach is very nicely maintained & ensures privacy to guests."
1095,"I recently stayed again at the JW Marriott Juhu Beach for my third and fourth visit.  I found the hotel to be excellent but wanted to highlight two special groups.  The first is the Executive Lounge group especially the morning breakfast crew  Michael the manager and the staff go out of their way to make you feel special.  The chef knows I like Dosa for breakfast and never disappointed me.   However, the person I would like to express my greatest thanks to is Rupesh, the massage therapists in the Quan Spa.  I have stayed at many hotels and he is by far the best therapists of any from around the world.  He knows exactly where to touch and how much pressure to exert.  Rupesh, don't ever leave this hotel!"
1096,"From the moment we stepped into the grand lobby, we  treated with the best service. They provided us with a complimentary upgrade to the executive lounge, which was a wonderful surprise (Note: Special thanks to Samantha and Evan  for being such warm and accommodating hosts in the lounge). Furthermore, I had injured my back during the stay and the team went beyond the duty providing fresh ice packs around the clock and arranging for any required medication. We were fortunate enough to use the famed JW Spa and were not dissapointed! Quite pricey, but worth every penny! While we did not use the pool, you could tell that it was a beautiful setting right on the beach (the sunsets were heavenly). The morning breakfast had everything one could desire, from mouth-watering western"
1097,"IF your in Mumbai just for a couple of days on business this hotel is close to the airport, has great beds and good service.  The hotel is on the beach but its not a beach that you would hang out on.  The pool, spa and restaurants at the hotel are good.  If you have a chance to go to the members lounge its the best part of the hotel with great service and food."
1098,"This is one of the most well known star hotels in Nir Mumbai.   Situated near the Juhu beach, the place has fab restaurants, pubs and spas besides lovely rooms to stay. Loved the buffet lunches at the hotel which are my favourite"
1099,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at.  The first thing I noticed stepping in were all the lush flower arrangements.  No matter where you are at the hotel the staff will always greet you with a smile.  Anything you want, they will try your best to make it happen.  The concierge is extremely helpful with any questions you may have about Mumbai.  The food is phenomenal and the chefs will prepare your breakfast on the spot, whatever you fancy.  I highly recommend this hotel."
1100,"Very good hotel, fantastic breakfast buffet. We also appreciated DJ  Pranav Desai a lot. He played in the Dashanzi resto/bar. His mix of golden oldies with a modern beat are just great!! We'll definitely go back next time we're in town üòÄ"
1101,"An amazing hotel, i'm a club member here, it feels like home being here and spending time working out, using all the facilities the Quan Spa is the best spa i have ever been to the best services are provided here i would recommend each and every one to visit Quan Spa for an unforgettable experience the best massage ever."

1104,"One of the Finest Service, Excellent Meal options, Chef deserve 7 star with outstanding breakfast options from around the world, attentive and most Courteous front desk and  lounge area, friendly concierge staff, great cafe, outdoor pool by the ocean, centrally located to mumbai city and best value for money. Needs few upgrades with USB charging and the paintings in the room needs replaced."
1105,"With amazing views of Arabian sea and luxurious rooms and the best hospitality , one is in for a fantastic time at this Hotel. It is very large so plenty on offer to do. From various restaurants and other refinements you expect from a 5 star hotel. Service is excellent as is the food.  The rooms are big, spacious , luxurious and clean. Their are world cuisines to choose form and the coffee is finest."
1106,"It has all essence of relaxation, good life, good food, spending good time with family and friends, lot of veriety in food, just opposite juhu beach so u can enjoy sea shore as well from ur balcony, swimming pool also has good view of sea. Nice place, recommended for all who want to spend luxurious day, warm welcomed by staff and all arrangements were proper"
1107,"Excellent room, service. People go out of the way to make your stay memorable. We were fortunate to stay and use the executive lounge. Michael at the lounge treated us dearly, making sure we are well taken care of. Sumeet was very pleasant. Thank you guys for treating us so well. Sure a memorable time here and will come back again. We stayed on the 4th floor with exec. Lounge. Room was large, well equipped with everyday a special touch."
1108,This is a very luxurious hotel located on the Arabian Sea. Everyone that works in this hotel does such a marvelous job. They always stop to say hello whenever they see you walk by.  The gym is great and has all the equipment you need and also staff available to help out  The breakfast buffet is amazing!!!!! Whatever type of food you desire they have it available and if they don't they will make it for you.  The executive lounge has great views and is a good place to get away from the crowds.   Everyone that works here does such a great job and takes great pride in their job.  The rooms are big and gorgeous. The Marriott bed is always so comfy that you don't want to get out.
1109,"Everyone in this hotel does his best to make you feel home. Starting from the front desk, to the various chefs of various restaurants, to room service. Couldn' t be better. From now on I will stay here every time I am in Bombay. Location is convenient too. Right on the beach."
1110,Excellent hotel and incredible hospitality .would awlays prefer to stay at the j w marriot whenever am in mumbai.from the room service to the staff over all were very friendly and co operative in all the aspects.
1111,"Worst experience at Lotus Cafe buffet lunch. 1. Was told over phone that there's Awadhi food too and decided to go there but it was not so. The manager tells me there is chichen tikka, seekh kebab. I didnt know I have to tell at Marriott what Awadhi means after which they got me a serving of Galauti kebab which took 40 mins. 2. While waiting,  i asked for a strawberry punch and i was served fruit punch. Sent it back , but then again comes the fruit punch after 20 mins and the waiter says this is strawberry punch ! Had to ask the incharge there, Ms Trishala and finally got the right strawberry punch after 35 mins. 3. But thats not the end...after all this delay, when i went to have dessert , it was a pathetic sight. Most of the desserts were deserted with some other guests also"
1112,I must say Jw marriot is the best option for stay and I will recommend to people to do enjoyment in this hotel .The staff was so nice specially venkatesh in the gym and Michael in executive lounge ...they both r very nice . I always choose no other option.
1113,I was very amazed to stay at the hotel the hospitality was amazing and incomparable. I thank to Samantha and Michel and Ivan for assisting me completely and providing me with the best service on a birthday.
1114,Exceptional hotel with first class service and facilities.  On arrival I was personally greeted as a Silver Elite Member and the check in process was quick and personal - greatly appreciated.  Each I time I travel to Mumbai I stay here and I am never disappointed.  The staff are attentive and helpful at all times.  The room is very comfortable and well equipped and the restaurants are excellent.    I would always stay here and would highly recommend the Marriott Juhu to any traveler.  Thank you Juhu another very comfortable stay.
1115,This review is long overdue. I stayed at the JW last November for 10 nights. The original plan was to spend 3 nights but the service was incredibly good to the point where I kept extending. The staff at the executive lounge...  Samantha Pereira  and her team were awesome. Thank You !!! . My thanks to all the other staff around the hotel as your guys were amazing.
1116,"We stayed a night in the ocean view room. The rooms are neat, spacious, staff is courteous and helpful. The food is good but priced exorbitantly.if you want to cherish the five star experience, then worth a visit."
1117,We stay every years three days to relex when we travel from U.K. To my village friendly staff good English breakfast specially I love there masala tea in night time from back u can enter to walk juhu beach atmosphere in hotel very lively in night time money is worth if stay here
1118,It was an awesome experience to be staying here. The whole family enjoyed the experience including the kids. The rooms were clean. We were well taken care of. Staff was very courteous. Our check in & check out was very fast in less than 10 minutes. We were accompanied to the rooms upon check in. The food was also excellent. The kids enjoyed the meals too.
1119,"I love this Juhu property, and it is not just the nice building, pools and location. The secret sauce that makes a hotel feel like HOME is the staff. I want to highlight and thank some of the excellent staff that you have.  Siddharth has been wonderful to work with. I told him that my wife is accompanying me on this trip. He along with Priyanka, Samantha organized a great welcome event for us in the lobby. They also remembered that it was my wife's birthday and they organized a great cake/flowers. My wife (and I) were very impressed.  Priyanka, Samantha had a great idea about Platinum members only Cocktail event in the Chinese restaurant. It is a brilliant idea and I wish more Marriott properties adopt this event.  Michael in the lounge is awesome to work with and is very"
1120,"I had a wonderful stay at JW Marriot Juhu. The staff made my stay very enjoyable and comfortable. I would like to name members of the staff who i feel deserves recognition for their heartwarming professionalism. I would like to start with Trishla Desai from the Lotus Caf√©. She was always attenting to my family and i's needs. We quickly became attached to her amazing personality. I always looked forward to dining at the Lotus caf√© because of her. I'd also like to commend Chef Metha and Chef Nishard for always checking up us and making sure we have everything we need. Also Chef Metha sends special dishes from the kitchen for us!! Chef Metha made this wonderful Egg Benedict sandwich for me which was so good!! Also from the Lotus Cafe, i would like to commend Anil, Dilip,Giles, and"
1121,"Terrible bruchettas, pizzas, raviolis,lasagneas, the pumpkin soup.....you name they spoil it.....i use to love this place but strictly avoid this place....service is great, the staff tries best to cover up for the food, but food is pathetic...Best Avoided."
1122,Thee BBC @ JW martiottt is a quaint cosy corner cafe with a delicious bakery. They have yummy breads to choose from and a variety of cakes a d pastries. Also available are assorted drinks and perrier water. The menu is very varied and interesting for a light snack. Juices are freshly made to order. Good for  health freaks as they have vegetable boosters as well.  My favourite is the Quinoa chat with crushed ragi chips..
1123,"Stayed here with a couple of friends who have stayed here several times before and told me it was thee place to stay in Mumbai, I wouldn't disagree. The layout of the hotel is amazing, the rooms are light and airy with excellent high quality decor. The breakfast is to die for and the outdoor pool area looks like something out of ancient Egypt. The staff are always nice and smiling, nothing is too much to ask for. Can't wait to go back."
1124,"30 minutes away from international airport, amazing staff , delicious cusines, nice and soft music, great ambience and infrastructure, one of the best hotels gor stay in mumbai, lovely beach besides the hotel, they have an amazing gym and spa facilities which is very nicely and traditionally maintained."
1125,"This is amongst Mumbai's top notch luxury hotel properties.  The pools, fitness centre and view of the beach outside is amazing. Has many quality restaurants and the coffee shop is just fantastic. Room are luxurious and well maintained. Service of staff is also quite exemplary."
1126,The rooms are so comfortable and quiet with beautiful pool and or ocean views. Always a rejuvenating and relaxing experience. Some rooms give you an added view of the city skyline and the pool views are beautiful and peaceful.
1127,"I'm dissatisfied and disappointed with the quality of food and the spread. Used to be among Mumbai top spreads, I'm shocked with the quality. Stale, cold and tasteless for the most part, the live counters suck as well.  Don't waste your money eating the super expensive buffet at Marriott Juhu."
1128,"Excellent service in all aspects. the staff is very courteous and friendly. warm hospitality. always eager to help and smiling. the same applies to all departments be it front desk,spa, restaurants, Gymnasium, housekeeping and all others part of the hotel.  the ambience and service is excellent along with great location and facilities.  Had used for stay at previous occasions and will use it more in future and highly recommended to all to experience it once and then you like to repeat the same in future."
1129,"I booked this hotel as a splurge for relaxation at the end of a month of traveling in India.  The property was even better than I could have asked for!  The pools were so relaxing.  Yoga & the fitness center allowed me to work out some travel kinks.  And the staff are just exceptional, attending to needs and wants I didn't even know I had!!  Special thanks to Rajendra, Nishad, Swati, and Ivan for making our stay extra-special :).  The beach is unfortunately not swimmable due to water quality, but it is pretty to look at.  Would definitely recommend staying here."
1130,"I along with my family dined at the Saffron Restaurant at JW Marriott, Juhu, Mumbai. The occasion - my daughter's 11th Birthday!  They had a great spread of veg & non veg Indian delicacies and desserts. With live Indian music and an impressive beverage list to boot, Saffron is worth going to for that leisurely, special dinner. The service is great but never overbearing.  Highly recommended"
1131,If you can indulge ask for the sea view rooms and if not ask for an upgrade at the desk. Might be you get lucky.  The sea view rooms are amazing. The sun set is pretty.  The room sizes are decent. The hotel also has great restaurants.
1132,I've stayed at this hotel several times for business and I enjoyed all my stays. The service is great and the rooms are comfortable. One thing I can never have enough of is the Indian food in the main restaurant (it's to die for).
1133,"Each of the rooms I stayed in, had a spectacular view of the sea and its moods, specially during the monsoons. We have held three trainings here and each time, it has been better than the last. Our participants now feel very much at home, making friends with the chefs, ordering 'khichri', local street food, etc.   I must make special mention of Hemant who cleaned up my room and made beautiful towel sculptures - a new one every day. His smile could light up your whole day. So also, the waiters in the Lotus Cafe like Durgesh and Rajesh, so proud of their hotel and expertise.   I have stayed in many hotels around the world but this ranks as one of the best."
1134,Stayed in the hotel for night. It is a good place located next to beach. However had dirty coffee cups in the room. Room cleanliness needs improvement. Food at the executive centre was also very limited. Had a good meal at the Chineese restaurant .
1135,"I stayed here for only one night unfortunately, as I wished I could have stayed for longer.  The staff, the food, setting and the rooms were fabulous. I was here on business and being a Marriott member I was very kindly upgraded.  The hotel is very luxurious, modern and clean."
1136,The JW Marriott is a stunningly beautiful property with amazing rooms that are very contemporary and comfortable.Stayed here for a conference and everything was well organised.The breakfast spread was amazing.The hotel has 3 pools and a great spa.
1137,"Right from the time I checked in, this property and its employees helped make sure I was going to have the best stay ever. It was the excellent hospitality that made me return for my second trip and based on this trip, I am never going to stay elsewhere in Mumbai. Excellent accommodations, transfers back and forth from the airport, the breakfast buffet, the access to the beach and above all, the special touches (flowers, cake, pictures) helped make sure this will be a highlight in itself when we remember our Mumbai trip any time in the future."
1138,"The hotel is in best location . Juhu beach 3 minutes walk . The pool and Gym are best part of this property. Breakfast is awesome, pulls you early from ypur bed . Weekends are too crowdy and you will have to wait to get seated . Disappointment : checkin  .  Lunch and dinner , if you are ok with the Buffet , it has plently of choices .  Room service is very poor .  Overall Has edge due to location .  The Airport drop by Audi was a good experience , Mr Chopra who drove us back is entertsining and very lively person to chat .  Ask for him to go around Mumbai, if you are new to Mumbai ."
1139,"India is a great country, but its hotels are a mess.  Even the so called 5 star properties fail in areas.  Something always juuuust short of where it should be.  We booked multiple rooms at this property since we work in Hollywood and alot of Bollywood likes to take meetings here.  Upon entering the lobby its quite impressive.  Check In was nice.  Some of us got great staff, and a couple not so great.   We were offered drinks during the check-in process (which they could smooth out a bit...took a  long time)  The rooms are nice enough, but its time for a renovation.  They feel more 1995 luxury (which as a kid I loved) Today, umm not so much.  My room also had mosquitoes in the corner, so had to switch rooms during my stay.     The food was spectacular when it came to the buffet"
1140,"The JW Marriott at Juhu Beach, is an excellent hotel.  Of course it's beautiful and has a delicious breakfast buffet in a giant sun-filled dining room with all kinds of cuisine - but it's the spa and gym that really stand out as extraordinary facilities.  There are at least a dozen treadmills, very helpful personal trainers, large free weight area and a variety of machines in the spacious gym.  In the luxurious spa beside that space there's a variety of rejuvenating options available.  My experience is however only with the massages - excellent, by the way - and the nice steam room, so that by the time you're finished they could pour you into a bed, where a welcome sleep will help you recover from your jet-lag.  Personally, I can also recommend the group yoga classes in their"
1141,"I travel to Mumbai monthly for my work. So I would like to¬† compliment the excellent staff in the executive lounge. As a gold member I really appreciate a quiet atmosphere yet pleasant & professional service. This staff provides that.   ¬† There is Ivan who is always welcoming, cheerful & friendly, along with Swati. Then the wait staff, like Pradeep & Alex, who always have a great meal suggestion & willingly prepare a plate to alow guests to continue to work. I am so impressed with the professionalism of Samantha who seems to remember the name of every guest making each if us feel so special. And I must not forget to thank Chef Nishaad who is OUTSTANDING! I am truly impressed with the staff at the Mumbai JW Marriott, Juhu."
1142,"I had stayed here for a conference in July. The hotel is quiet well kept and the staff is very helpful and courteous. The gym is well equipped..but would suggest people to definitely go for a swim in the pool in the evening, as one can enjoy the sunset view while swimming in the pool."
1143,"I have been regular to this property as a Club Marriott member which indulge you to the best hospitality experience.  My sincere thanks to Shambhavi at front desk for special attention and welcome to us.  Durgesh from Lotus Cafe was very friendly in discussing with us on lunch requirements and I    appreciated wide spread of desserts, chat corner, pasta, salads variety. along with name tags at various food sections to identify it quickly.  Vivek and his team at Saffron quickly served dal khichdi to my daughter as a special attention to young guest.  The menu Reshmi Kabab, Paneer Makhnwala was delicious followed by complimentary ice cream for young guest and meetha paan.  The newest addition is breakfast at Bombay Baking Company and enjoyed it in presence of chocolate pastry,"
1144,"Stayed for three nights at the property, Was attended by good staff and received great service. Breakfast spread was wonderful. The restaurants were also serving nice food. Chef of the Chinese Restaurant took extra care of us. So did the staff at the lower lobby."
1145,JW marriott is a very happening and good hotel centrally located in sub urbans of Mumbai. The only problem is service quality with in room dining and cashier which eats lot of time to dp their job. Rooms are good. Swimming pool is awsome overseeing sea in Juhu and next to Juhu beach. INDIAN VEGETARIAN FOOD AND CHINESE COHSIB IS VERY GOOD AND TASTY. Hotel rates are a bit on higher side.  My view it should not be more than 8000 including tax in INR and competitive.
1146,"I'm a Platinum Rewards Member. Last stayed at this property five years ago. It's as top-shelf now as it was then. Staff are impeccable, property is stunning. Food is superb. Highly recommended for anyone on business or pleasure."
1147,"I'd give this hotel 7 Stars if I could!! JW Juhu has been my preferred hotel in Mumbai and everytime I stay here, the staff finds a way to go one up on my previous experiences. The location, view and amenities are stupendous but it's the staff hospitality that tops it all for me. From the front desk, to the Executive Lounge to even the chefs, hospitality is in this hotel's DNA and they go the extra mile to make it a memorable stay.   The executive lounge staff in particular tops the experience and they go about it with a genuine warmth and professionalism.   I've seen families stay here on the weekends and can see how it can be a great place for families too. If you're a discerning business traveler who appreciates class and practicality, JW Marriott Juhu is the place to stay in"
1148,"Again a great experience during our stay at JW Marriott - Juhu. The rains in Mumbai, can make getting around tough. JWM offers an oasis away from it all. The beach access is a plus.  The Saffron buffet area was busier this time (than usual), but the quality of food and variety made up for it. As always, the staff was courteous and attended to the minutest needs.  A special mention to the gym staff that is always eager to assist."
1149,Hotel with ocean view offers a broad selection to make your stay unforgettable. The staff is unbelievable friendly and the breakfast invites you to stay longer. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Really enjoyed my stay
1150,"JW marriott Juhu is really an awesome place to stay. Located right at famous Juhu beach, spacious property with lot of space for everything. Rooms are spacious. The beach view rooms give a good view of garden as well as ocean."
1151,"The warm friendly service from everyone, and I truly mean everyone at the JW, keeps me coming back year after year! Thanks to the front desk staff, especially Priyanka 1 and Priyanka 2 for making this a fun trip!"
1152,Fabulous breakfast.nice staff.beautiful view.Good situation........ Near sea.not good beach.perfect pool but not good weather will I am.the room was tidy . Crowded street.all cars just horn not driving
1153,"Had a chance to try out this restaurant while staying at this hotel, when we had some guests visit us.  The first thing I liked was the deco , very soothing!!  The menu was exciting so asked the staff to recommend.this turned out to be a good move as this was the best meal we have ever had in Mumbai. I would like to thank the following staff for all their service, Brinston, Rahul,Anirudh,Sandeep and most of all to Vivek , the manager who was so helpful."
1154,Room excellent. Hotel and staff excellent. i was not well and they went all out to get the doctor for me and gave me hot kichidi.   The service is very personal. :) I love the staff there. Caring kind .. and of course you get to see alot of bollywood actors just by sitting in the lobby
1155,I love the hotel and all the amenities. But ....especially I love Samantha who was the lounge manager but now is Guest Relations Manager. She is the best!!!thank you for all your smiles when I visit once a week.
1156,"I've been staying at JW Marriott during my trips to Mumbai for around 20 years and can safely that it has never disappointed. It's great that this excellent hotel is within 30 minutes of Chattrapati Shivaji Airport as well as areas offering fabulous shopping.  Most recently, I stayed there in May 2017 and again in June-July 2017 and found the service exceptional - from Reception staff to Housekeeping to Concierge Desk to Lotus Cafe and Bombay Baking Company. I needed some help from the Marketing team - Sagar Achpal - and even they were amazing.   The food at the Lotus Cafe is simply sumptuous. Appreciate the superb hospitality extended by Sous Chef, Mr Mehta and various managers, such as Prabhaker.   The Bombay Baking Company (the Indian BBC :-) ) is wonderful too for hot drinks"
1157,"I stayed here for three weeks on business and it must be amongst the best hotel stay I have ever had. Admittedly, I did use the wonderful executive lounge which made a huge difference,but, even so, this is a fabulous hotel with great facilities and a really special staff. The work ethic of most of the staff is amazing. They all give of their very best to make sure that guests have the best experience possible. Their aim is to make you feel part of a family and, certainly for long staying guests, they achieve that perfectly. They helped me celebrate my birthday in real style. The boy who looked after my room, Ganesh, gave me little amusements by folding towels into amusing animal shapes and leaving occasional flowers. These small gestures are so welcomed by long staying guests"
1158,"Overall the JW in Mumbai is by far one of the best. Everything from the lobby to the spa is amazing. It gives you a resort feeling in the city, with amazing pools and ocean views. It is a great location for anybody that wishes to visit areas like Juhu, Khar, and Bandra. Service is fantastic and rooms are well sized and designed. The Lotus Cafe for breakfast is a must!! If you are a Marriott member also make sure to check out the executive lounge. You can't go wrong with this fantastic hotel!"
1159,"The Room I got was very spacious and clean as well. At the time of entry into the hotel itself, you feel the positive vibes. Reception staff is very helpful and welcome. Juhu beach is very nearby from the hotel and after crossing the hotel lobby, you get the magnificent view of the beach itself through a range of palm trees."
1160,A finest hotel in Mumbai with nice view of the Arabian sea. Comfortable rooms with all modern amenities and fresh food aroma in the restaurant.Staffs are decent and very prompt. It's always a great experience. Thanks
1161,"What can i say about JW? Simple ""THE BEST IN MUMBAI"" The food the ambiance the service is fantastic.. We have a two year old and he was treated like a king. The pool, gym, spa and rooms are totally on the very best  standard.. keep it up JW."
1162,We had a excellent stay at the hotel and we were very well received by Priyanka Undale the front office Executive and were upgraded to Suite due to my Platinum status which was really excellent so our family could be together. Priyanka does go a step ahead to make sure guests are well attended and comfortable and Thank you Victor for your kindness.  It was very considerate of the hotel and it was a really wonderful family gathering we had 6 rooms at the hotel.  The restaurants are amazing and all of us had a lovely stay. Specially Dashanji had great music and oriental choices.  Evan and Samantha at the executive lounge are excellent hosts and become best friends with my daughter :-)......  would recommend this hotel for any family gathering.
1163,"I arrived in Mumbai on 3rd of June 2017 and checked into the JW Marriott on Juhu Road. It is a beautiful property , well maintained and situated in front the Arabian Sea üåä ! I have stayed at the JW Marriott many, many times for business , but this trip was special because I would be attending a wedding of a dear friend! We were greeted by 2 beautiful girls PFUB and PRIYANKA on arrival and had a very warm and speedy check in with SAIF and HARRY at the front desk , which was much appreciated after a 16 hour flight ‚úàÔ∏è!

1164,Nice family hotel with gd location . With activities for kids . Have a nice swimming pool and other small activities . The view from the rooms is good the have lot of open area and huge property . Have good options for restaurants . One should prefer the speciality restaurants as compared to the cafe . Need some improvement in hospitality as staff is not very  courteous as compared to other Marriott properties . Over all kids and family enjoyed and had fun
1165,"Came here to celebrate my birthday and had the most wonderful time. We got a beautiful seafaring room. All the hotel staff went out of their way to take care of us and make me feel special. The restaurants are great. Amazing food, great staff, beautiful location. Delightful pool."
1166,"Very accommodating, friendly and the best staff all around. If you need anything they will help you.  Transportation is great as well. Food deliciously good and kid friendly as well.  My kids were very happy with the pool."
1167,"We have been staying at this hotel for over 10 years.Regular rooms are small,so we book a suite. We like this hotel primarily for: 1)Excellent service 2)Good food 3)Great location.    Breakfast is one of the most delicious ,elaborate and varied we have had anywhere.Chefs mill around and pay special attention to everyone's needs.  Dinner choices are varied.We had dinner in the Indian restaurant one night last week and found a couple of dishes too salty.The chef apologized,offered to make amends and the restaurant did not charge us. The housecleaning crew is attentive and friendly. The gym is well appointed.   I have only 2 complaints: 1)Check in is slow and the reception staff is not always well trained 2)The doormen are very greedy.They will hold the door open after you get into"
1168,Lovely hotel to stay centrally located.  Staff and check in no problem  Rooms are quite and well equipped  Gym is great  Food is good in lotus and the Chinese place Staff are fantastic and very friendly and helpful which makes it's very comfortable  Would recommend
1169,Juhu Marriott is an iconic property. Located on chowpati beach it has a certain advantage. Mumbai is a city that decides your hotel stay depending on where you'd be going out to work. I happened to have work in and around Juhu and stayed here. Aside of how all Marriott properties have a certain charm what I enjoyed the most was their fitness centre. It's wonderfully large but super crowded. All in all good property and very good hospitality.
1170,"This was an excellent property.  The service and hospitality was very much up to the JW standards.  The front desk was helpful, the rooms were in excellent condition.  The lounge was well equipped.  The entire experience was a great one."
1171,Wonderful hotel with a superb view. Both JW cafe and Saffron serves scrumptious food. Great ambiance. Food serves there at Executive Lounge was delicious. Service was good. Overall good experience. Kudos to team JW
1172,One of the best hospitality service and food at saffron. Superb place to spend family time. Each and every one from family was very happy.  From adults to young kids the menu was loved. Service was prompt. Warm and special treatment by the hotel was given. I would highly recommend saffron for the indian food and well known Indian hospitality.
1173,"As soon as we reached hotel front desk, we were greeted warmly with prompt allotment of room which was sea facing. The room was spacious with very good ambience. The hotel is located in Juhu, which is one of the best suburbs of Mumbai. The sea facing hotel offers a great view. We found the room relaxing. Excellent food at Lotus cafe. We missed dinner at Saffron as it was fully booked well in advance but there is always next time. Overall we felt positive vibes about the hotel and will visit often."
1174,This is one of the best JW property. Their pool along with sea pool just next to Juhu beach makes it totally worth place. Your kids gonna love this place. Views from executive lounge was awesome. Staff was very supportive and had a good time with them. Will come back there soon.
1175,The hotel is really great in all respects. It is ideally located on the seafront. The infrastructure and landscaping are very nicely maintained. The personnel in all departments are very well trained and very caring. Those who do the bed are very thorough. The restaurant personnel is outstanding as they really assist you to enjoy your meal. The personnel want to do that extra mile for the client.
1176,"BEST soothing sunset view of the BUSY juhu beach watched from the comforts of room and bath. and the club lounge. Excellent service at reception rooms, considerate housekeeping staff and best spread  in the world at breakfast. The rooms are well kept with every detail being promptly attended to."
1177,"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and during my stay it happened to be my birthday. One I will never forget as the hotel made sure my day was special! The staff helped me organise a trip to the Taj Mahal for my birthday, made me a cake and gave me flowers. I stayed in the executive room with business lounge access which was wonderful. The views of the beach and pool from the lounge were amazing and also they had the best Sambal I have ever tasted. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel was amazing, the staff, including the wonderful Champa made my stay that extra special. The pool is wonderful the food at all the restaurants had so much choice. I have never had such an amazing hotel experience ever. This is the only hotel to stay in when you visit Mumbai. Thank you JW Marriott"
1178,"The hotel is located bang on the beach. The rooms seem smaller than the Marriott Sahar.,but there is a really nice view of juhu from certain rooms, it is nice to watch the people on the beach and the waves coming in. I was a bit concerned about the lack of security especially on the beach side. But perhaps this is just me being paranoid.  The room itself is comfortable but has some weird paintings. There are sockets for different kinds of plugs which I was  grateful for. Also in the suite, the TV channels in the bedroom were less than the TV channels in the living room. Odd. The WIFI was for unlimited devices which was great. They also give an unlimited supply of water.  Housekeeping was efficient, just the cleaning carts lined up in an already narrow corridor are a bit"
1179,The staff here were brilliant! From our room attendant Manesh to eating in Mezo Mezo with the chef and other staff visiting our table to make sure we were ok and enjoying the amazing food. We even got a bon voyage cake when we left! Absolutely brilliant stay. The facilities here were also good and room was clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back!
1180,"I live in the same city and booked a room for 1 night for a weekend getaway. We loved staying at Marriott Juhu. Had booked their weekend getaway package which includes breakfast, dinner, 2 hour free cocktails, 1 bottle of wine. I found this package to be a good value for money.  We were a couple with an infant and were very well taken care off. Ashish at the front desk checked us in in a snap Swapnil at the swimming pool helped us inflate the swim float that we had carried for our child.  We had special dietary needs and all our food needs were well taken care off.  Chef Nisaar made sure we had enough food options, inspite of our dietary restrictions Babu at Mezo mezo made wonderful cocktails for us and got for us a Vegan pizza."
1181,"I just visited the hotel coffee shop for a meeting and my day was made by a very special guest relations person, Reshma Temang. She basically was the nicest, cordial and most helpful person. I'm definitely staying there next time. If you go there find her and say hello because she is the BEST."
1182,"I stayed at the JW juhu for a wedding and what a place it is. I have yet to experience hospitality like that in the city. The food, ambiance the staff, everyone deserves a special mention. I used to love the Arola restaurant but the current place also serves amazing delicacies"
1183,"As a first time business visitor to Mumbai, and India, the my most important needs for a Hotel are quality, hygiene, security and service. The JW Juhu did a fantastic job in all these areas. A reliable and comfortable Airport pick up with re-assuring and highly professional security at all entry points, sets the hotel off to a great start on arrival. Throughout my 2 week stay the service, attention to detail was excellent. Superb Indian food in the Saffron restaurant was a highlight along with a very comfortable Exec lounge, supported by the highly professional Ivan. Interestingly my American colleague and I had also been down to the historic Taj hotel for Tea and drinks, whilst this was beautiful and exotic, I preferred the service and ease of use at the JW. It was a perfect"
1184,"I stayed at JW juhu with my elder brother Mr Arnab Maity . As it's said that a character of an institution is reflected in its leader , I would appreciate Mr Pavithran ( G.M ) to have built a wonderful team with an applaudable group dynamic. I would like to mention a few associates who have been terrific . Starting from the lobby ,  Reshma has been wonderful and has been there at all times for any query I had or even a quick chat .  Dhruti and Shruti at the corporate lounge ensured the best at all times . Dhruti has been very helpful.  Out of all , I found Ivan to be the best among all the associates . The entire team of Jw Juhu is terrific .  If ever in Mumbai .. that's the place to be . Good luck ..  Anindya"
1185,"I would like to take a moment to thank all of the friendly and knowledgeable staff at the Juhu JW Marriott.  A few name s stand out from them, Pryanka Undale, Samantha Pereia, Iven Sen.  These folks have gone above and beyond their daily responsibilities.  I am very pleased with the food and service that the JW Marriott in Juhu.  Thank you!"
1186,"Good environment,ambience,and very prompt service.. Go to place for a quick meeting. Need a bit of change in the food menu otherwise a perfect place to conduct a meeting for healthy conversation. Compared to other coffee shop the service is really quick. The place is always busy and bustling  with activities."
1187,"Excellent service as always, from the time you check in, they make you feel special. The service is exceptional everywhere in the hotel, restaurants,lounge and even at the poolside. This is what makes you want to go back to this amazing hotel."
1188,"Needed a weekend away from city buzz and we chose a getaway within the city, beach front with three awesome pools... its an excellent getaway.  For dining my favorite restaurant here will be the quite new Dashanzi... must try.  On the whole a great stay other than a few minor blips."
1189,Hi Myself a frequent business traveller and last week I stayed in here. It was a great experience and was made an exhilarating one by the front desk manager Jigyasa Nigam. It was a long day and I was already dead tired by the time I was about to check in. She made the whole experience a special one by taking personal care - a personal touch beyond the call of duty and got a coffee mug sent to the room. A small gesture makes a lasting experience and I am looking forward to my next stay already.
1190,"Quality, modern, clean, spacious are just a few words to describe this place. The rooms are incredibly large. The position of the bed to the door is many steps away which means you hear no one walking up and down the corridors. Even tried the Italian restaurant (Rosano's)attached to the hotel and it was quality. Great ambiance and many menu items to choose from. Both the hotel and restaurant are winners."
1191,We checked in really really late (around 2 AM) in the night. The room had an amazing view of the sea. The breakfast was quite average and could have been better. The room service was quick and prompt. The staff was generally helpful but there was absolutely nothing extraordinary anywhere to catch our attentions.
1192,"My experience staying at the hotel was very positive mainly because of the excellent customer service provided by the hotel staff, particularly Ivan, who works at the hotel's lounge on the 4th floor, went out of his way to meet my requests.   Great food and ambience at both Saffron and Dashanzi! Tusha who works at the bar at Dashanzi was great. The hotel has a world-class gym with all the latest hardware and software and great trainers as well. I will definitely consider staying at the hotel again the next I visit Mumbai."
1193,"We had a bad experience at the JW Juhu last year, but tried the hotel one more time. 10 days in May 27th to 6th June were awesome. The staff starting from Front office Sarfraz who made sure our preferred room was ready for our arrival. Daily housekeeping support from Asif and Manish. Chef Nishad sent wonderful food to the room - food has always been great at the JW. Plus support from the bell desk and concierge on a daily bases. Also thanks to the personal intervention of Trishala Desai to ensure all was well this time round. All in all we will be back again and again."
1194,"""The Marriott Philosophy"" is alive and very well at the JW Marriott Juhu Beach and has been for the past 11 years that I have been fortunate to stay there as a guest. On this visit, my Super Stars were Samantha at the Front Desk and Tyson and Rajavendar (?) at the breakfast buffet. Such friendliness and incredibly genuine smiles! Samantha, at the Front Desk, possesses the perfect blend of professionalism and friendliness and her ""solution oriented"" Customer Service skills. My only criticism is that they decided to do away with bathtubs in lieu of rain head showers during the most recent guest room renovation, which I believe has been about five years. I miss a nice soak after a long flight from Newark to Mumbai! A side note: the floral arrangements in the Lobby area are always"
1195,"This is one of the best hotels in Mumbai with an awesome view to the beach. The service is very good, and the restaurants are excellent. I have stayed in this hotel many times, and still enjoying. In the evening times one can be irritated by the enormous traffic to and from hotel. The hotel has a very beautiful garden and pool, which is good for family visits."
1196,This place used to be my fab for dinners and family meals but unfortunately the recent experience made the place feel like it's loosing its charm. Right from the serving staff who kept forgetting everything such as bringing our cold drinks during desserts till the food choices in the menu of lotus restaurant. The valet guys have also become such poor quality which delays in getting your car and will hold on to your door till you tip. I wish they take initiative and bring back the lost glory.
1197,Everything about this hotel is awesome.  View of the beach from rooms and lounge is spectacular. Pool and hotel graden area looks great. Lot of celebrity houses nearby Got to take picture with Telugu superstar Mahesh babu when i was there and saw Anil Kapoor. Awesome it was.
1198,"I stayed here when my cousin got married a few years ago, and it was lush! I've always like marriott, but this hotel was something else! Just amazing! Rooms were nice with the view of the sea, but the dining area on the second floor was ridiculous, my eyes popped out of my head when I saw the food display! Great chef making amazing food! There were a few of us attending the wedding, and it was also hosted at the hotel in one of the event rooms, everything done up super nice, all staff were helpful. The night before the wedding we went into a on site dance club which was cool super dark in there though but I guess most clubs are! If you're looking for a wedding venue this is it! Even if not, just go and get pampered!!"
1199,"I've stayed here on a number of occasions and also at nearby Novotel, Sea Princess and Juhu Residency hotels. JW Marriott feels luxurious as soon as you enter, the staff treat you like royalty, the location is right on the beach, the decor is modern and luxurious, the pool area is private in a garden oasis (it's away from the restaurants), and the rooms are very comfortable and modern. I've only dined at the restaurant a few times as it gets a bit expensive (brunches are amazing); nearby are lots of good cheaper restaurants like: Cafe Moshe's, Fable cafe, Grandma's cafe, Dakshinayan (very basic but amazing south indian food) and Banana Leaf. An excellent hotel for solo female travellers.   The only cons: 1) too many scary crows at the pool, 2) we came for a wedding and the hotel"
1200,"This is a fantastic JW, exceeded my expectations in every way.  The room was very comfortable.  Great bed and linens.  It is very close to the airport.  You can barely hear the planes and it did not bother me.  The Executive Lounge is great.  Nice breakfast, great appetizers in the evening.  Each night a chef is there preparing a special.  The soup was great each night.  I especially want to recognize the outstanding staff who go out of their way at all times to help you.  In the lounge:  Aun and Nitesh.  At the reception desk:  Savita.  I will add that the spa was fantastic.  Clean, comfortable and beautiful.  Services are reasonably priced.  My therapist Tashi was fabulous.  I have back problems and she helped me a great deal.  I actually visited her 3 times during the week I"
1201,We stayed here for the weekend and found everything to be of high quality and well maintained. The pool area is outstanding and very big in size. Rooms are big and well maintained. Quality of food and service at Lotus Caf√© can be improved. But overall its a great hotel with beach access in the heart of Mumbai!
1202,"This property continues to be maintained very well--and the food at the Lotus Cafe ( buffet) has excellent and very wide range of dishes.   But the service at the table could be better--in terms of promptness, quick attention, and so on. The rooms are small but good, and have a view of the sea, but the beds sag quite a bit and could give you mild backache if you have a predispostion for lumbar problems!"
1203,"I have been staying in JW marriott Mumbai Juhu for last 4 years 2-3 times a year. I always enjoy my stay. I love the gym and Spa over there.  Very friendly staff Mr. Shaker is one of the best personal trainer I ve met we very professional and very polite person.   Saffron resturant is awesome,  the best Indian food Resturant in mumbai.  Amazing food it is kind of signature food.  The reaturant chef Mr. Qurishi is incredible you should try it, very taste and delicious food.  Location and oceans view are also amazing"
1204,"When you travel that far and to a different country you don't know whats awaiting for you. JW Marriott made me feel so welcome and home. very friendly people , whatever I needed they gladly accommodated. Amazing breakfast, all type of food, used the spa and it was great, also they have a very nice hair salon. Went there everyday during my stay."
1205,"After having had a Faulty Towers like experience at another hotel in Mumbai I was hopeful that the JW Marriott Juhu, having come highly recommended by two colleagues, would be a safe bet.   I stayed here on two separate occasions, both on the same business trip and each stay was for one night only. On both occasions I was travelling on a very late flight which would mean arriving at the hotel in the middle of the night. The staff were, on both occasions, extremely helpful and sympathetic. I am not at my best at 2am and the staff were gracious and generous with their smiles and assistance. I was upgraded (always a bonus) and the rooms were amazing. The beds were the most comfortable I can ever remember sleeping in. Soft and downy but firm. Generous numbers of pillows. Light and"
1206,"I cannot say enough good things about JW Marriott! I love it there! Every time I go there I am treated like royalty! I love the staff, they are the sweetest people! Anything I want, they get for me! They are the best! Shoutout to Sachin, Manu, Trishla, Vivik, Soham, Vijay, Rajtundra, and all the other wonderful staff that are part of JW Marriott! I love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1207,"Myself and my family dined at safron restaurant on Thursday although we were not staying in the hotel, we were able to just walk in.  The staff were lovely, attentive, and welcoming. I can't remember the name of gentlemen that served us, but he was knowledgeable about the menu, and catered our needs perfectly.   The food was very good, tasty, and the chef also bought out extra dishes for us to try, I can't remember what it was now but it was very good.  We had a slight mishap where a waiter spilled beer over my uncle by accident. But this was quickly cleared up, and at the end, the manager offered my uncle a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. This was really very kind of Mr Vivek, my uncle is a simple man and has never had this kind of gesture. I personally was very grateful"
1208,"I must say, Marriot really trains their staff very well, everyone, from the moment you step of the car, you feel the attentive service given. We had a comfortable ( despite the HOT Indian summer outside) stay, only venturing out after 6pm. Even soaking in the pool is useless, you feel even hotter. Tried the yoga class in the morning, which is a good way to start your day. Don't forget to try the buffet, the number of items (Breakfast/lunch/dinner) is just vast.  We enjoyed the live music on the foyer, during breakfast and dinner, the pianist is a great story teller too. We loved it. Note: please DO NOT go into the water at Juhu Beach. The sewage is being pumped into the sea 3 km away. So the sea is very polluted, full of ----. FYI : Amitabh Bachan's home is just around the"
1209,"This was my fourth stay at the JW in Juju, all for business. This time, my wife came along. We were greeted by Phub, a guest relations executive. She met us at the door and we did the check in in the room. On the second day, she found my wife in the lobby and upgraded us to a suite for the rest of our stay. Whenever she was around, she always greeted us and asked our we were doing and whether our stay was satisfactory. She also sent up a few goodies to my wife (cake, sweets, etc).  This customer service attention permeates the entire hotel. We ate at 3 of their restaurants and other than one late meal at the Lotus cafe, the service was super attentive. The food selection and preparedness was just way above average. At the Asian restaurant, I had a shrimp dumpling with a touch of"
1210,Stayed for one night and found it good. Checkin process was very smooth. Room was clean and neat including the bathroom. Service was pretty good. Breakfast had a good spread. My room had a beautiful view of the ocean. Would recommend to stay at this hotel
1211,"Great hotel. Very clean in all areas. Quality and variation of food very good.  Ate in hotel for breakfast each day, dinner one evening and one room service. Best waffles I have had!  Staff friendly and helpful.  Great value for money.  I would definitely stay here again whether business or leisure."
1212,"I have stayed here so many times that I feel like home. The grand entrance off the busy road, splendid lobby, superb ambiance, excellent service and grand breakfast feels so effortless. I have stayed in many Marriotts and many hotels around the world but this one is the tops. An occasional bollywood celebrity sighting is a bonus. I miss the morning walks on the beach followed with some fresh coconut water and then sit down for a luxurious breakfast buffet. nice way to get out of the hustle and bustle of mumbai.  My kids swear by it and will probably refuse to go to mumbai if it does not include a stay here. I used to be Platinum at the time of reviews and now that I have no status i would love to see next time if they keep up the excellent service for a regular silver Marriott"
1213,"Hi!üëãüèº Recently we went to Mumbai for a family vacation (9th May till 13th May) and thought of putting up at J.W. Marriott Mumbai. You would experience a horrific experience of the help desk in case you have called them for some assistance regarding your booking as we were put on hold 4 times for the call to be transferred to the Mr/Ms Right who would help us with our booking and after holding phone for 30-35 minutes, the phone would get disconnected without anybody coming on phone. All your efforts in calling them again and telling them that you were put on hold would go in vain as you are bound to experience the same ordeal again and again. Now try writing to them as they just not in a mood to talk. This time our concern was that we were requesting a sea facing view and in"
1214,"The general design of this hotel is quite nice, but despite the recent updates it still shows signs of its age.  Were this an historic building that would be fine, but it appears to be a concrete structure from the sixties or seventies...not an era for great architecture.  The hallways smell badly in places and the walls in the hallways show their age.  When looking out our hotel room window onto the pool area, I noticed there are concrete sections that jut out 12 inches or so from the windows across the entire rear facade of the hotel.  These were painted white, but are so stained with bird pooh, other stains and chipping paint that it takes away from the great view.  That being said, overall the hotel was lovely - our room was clean, the staff were incredible, the executive"
1215,"Manager Jizab was extremely kind and hospitable . I was there to celebrate Mothers Day with my mother.   I felt so special and so well taken care of .  Mr Jizab is an asset , HE Marriott . Keep up the great work . I wish you success in life Jizab ."
1216,"Thank you to the staff at the JW Marriott Juhu for making our stay in Mumbai as relaxing as possible in a sea of fascinating, energy. Everything was top notch; breakfast buffet, Saffron restaurant, spa (my wife and I each had TWO 90-minute masssages during the week!), pool, car service. Also try Mahesh Lunch Home restaurant only steps away from the hotel."
1217,"Stayed at this hotel in the second week of Feb 2017 , nice and cosy room , beautiful view from the Ocean view room , the restaurant has lot of choice for dinner as well as breakfast and the food is very tasty. Room service is quick. Overall a good experience."
1218,we stayed at  26-Aug 2016. Great Ambience!! This is a very nice n Beautifull Hotel with Quite/Clean rooms and close to Airport and Beach. Very easy quick access to Airport and really in center on Mumbai . Breakfast quite good options and quality is also good.
1219,"I really enjoyed the stay in this hotel all the facilities are perfect , the restaurant , the location near the beach ,the swimming pool ,the amazing spa with really very kind staff especially Mr. Sachin Rao and all the members of the Quan Spa also i want to make special thank for outstanding service provided by Mrs Jasmeen and all the other members. Also i want to thank every one work in this hotel."
1220,"The perfect getaway, JW Marriott Juhu is a luxurious property. It has all the top class amenities one could ask for in a hotel.  Overlooking the Arabian Ocean, its room offers one of the best views in the city.  Perfect food. Perfect ambiance. Courteous staff.  In all a perfect leisure hotel."
1221,"I only stayed here for a one night stop over, but loved the room and the service. Also it is quite convenient being close to the airport.  Staff is very friendly and I really loved the breakfast spread that they had :)"
1222,"Best experience ever in Mumbai, staff were your cooperative. Multiple restaurants in the hotel. Best place to hangout, travel accomadations, city guide reference. Will choose this hotel next time even."
1223,"I was planning to spend a weekend in Mumbai catching up with couple of social events as well write second edition if my book "" Heart to Heart"" When i wrote to reservation for some details, including upgrade based on my Marriotts Rewards member, they were so kind and accommodative to provide me a free upgrade , adjusted meal timings, fabulous buffet at their Case,and of course late check out for which no-one bothered me to remind when I checked out an hour later then the check out time. I strongly recommend to stay at this Hotel in future in Mumbai, whether its business or pleasure. Rooms are great, views of oceans are great, beds, pillows, bathrooms impeccable. The food is fantastic. The email response of the staff at JWM Juhu was fantastic. Mr.Victor Chen and Pavithran Nambiar"
1224,"I stayed here for a night and I was delightful to have picked this property. The staff was welcoming and friendly at my arrival. The staff went an extra mile and gave me an early check-in seeing that I was a long distance traveller.  During my check in I was offered drinks or some coffee just to de stress.  The hotel entry is grand and luxuries.  I took a club room facing the sea. The room was clean and tidy. The bed sheets were crisp which I personally liked.  The bathroom was stylish and clean.  One thing I noticed that the floor has was not cleaned properly ( but I assume to give me an early check they would have cleaned the room in hurry, so I ignore that easily)  The food was amazing. I tried their buffet breakfast & dinner and I must say that it was an enjoyable experience"
1225,"We stay here for a few night in April 2017.We  were greeted at the front door again in the lobby by the friendly staffs.Once checked in, the employee walked us to our room. the room is very clean and we have a view of the Juhu beach. wonderful experiences stay at this hotel."
1226,I got very very sick at this hotel - JW Marriott Mumbai - I ate the beef and was sick to the point of wanting to die for 48 hours before vomiting the beef out of my stomach.   I was going to sue Marriott. Stay away from the beef when you're in this hotel.
1227,"I love staying at the JW Marriott. It has a great location by the sea, although that makes it harder when you are on a business visit in terms of getting to places like Andheri and South Mumbai. The rooms are a little small, but the staff are very friendly and helpful. On my last visit in early April, I enjoyed the delights of the BBC, my favorite sandwich place in Mumbai, breakfasts in the coffee shop were delightful, and the dinner at the Saffron was also good. Their gym is one of the best in hotels. Open and well laid out and very well maintained. I had some issues with the billing, in spite of many reminders, and eventually I had to pay for 4 other people's no shows, who actually showed up early morning the day after, and were prepared to pay for the previous night. This had"
1228,"We stayed for several nights at this delightful hotel on few occasions recently. We have been here before and returned to rejuvenate previous experience of a fascinating bubbly hotel. We again had a very good time but we were appalled to notice a constant confusion among the front desk and the reservation staff about our reservations, they all had different perception as to what we had booked for. There seems to be a gross lack of effective and accurate communication leading to uncertainty and chaotic attitude.  We shall nevertheless again return as the hotel is just a superb place for spending few days on the pool with good selection of food and an access to the unclean beach, the juju effect!!  J Sharma U.K."
1229,"We stayed here for a night in late April 2017.    Our partial sea view room was very comfortable, appreciated the complimentary fruit, general cleanliness and that we could plug our pendrives/ computer to the TV. Not a fan of the bathroom design, which is designed to be continuous with the room and has no lockable door, just sliding wooden partitions. The amenities are superlative; well-maintained gym, exceptional Relaxation Rooms with Sauna, Steam and Jacuzzi, superb pools areas. The hotel is getting a bit dated though and needs refurbishment in some areas and maybe a new paint job.  Their service is exemplary! From the front desk (Harendra was awesome) to the servers, the spa attendants to the pool lifeguards, everyone greets you with a smile, asks if they can be of help and"
1230,Stayed there as a delegate in the conference. Rooms are big with good ambience.The hotel staff is polite and helping.The food quality in restaurant is OK particularly vegetarian food which needs to be improved. Overall is a good place and I recommend it strongly.Free wi fi is a bonus.
1231,"I stayed at this hotel for about 2 nights on a business trip.   No doubt it is one of the grander hotels in the city.  Absolutely on the beach, very close to Juhu Chowpatty, brilliant location, luxurious stay, some good restaurants.  But need to mention that being the older of the JW MARRIOTTs in Mumbai, the property looks a tad bit old, rooms are smaller and have too much of fittings inside. Good if you like the older feel, but otherwise, go for the JW MARRIOTT SAHAR. Bigger rooms, younger and more energetic staff. Little things like the energy of the staff at the restaurants matter a lot - and that's when you see how energetic and welcoming the staff in the Sahar property is.  However, Overall, a comfortable stay."
1232,"One of the best breakfast buffets i have had with a large spread....they have a live waffle, dosa, eggs and pancake counter.... a large variety of different breads and fruits...it is expensive but worth it.."
1233,We had a 2 day event here. The staff is helpful and efficient. Food service could be better. Room was overlooking the beach and was  the  biggest incentive to be staying here. Overall satisfactory and pleasant.
1234,"Aesthetically appealing design, world-class hospitality, unique breakfast/brunch in the Lotus Cafe. This property is very well-managed, as there is clearly a culture of primary attention to guest service. Front desk, food services, back office, front lobby, and concierge are full of stellar brand ambassadors. Suites and hotel vehicles could use an update. Dashanzi (new Asian restaurant) is situated just below the oceanfront suites (-01 line), and loud party/nightclub music was an unintended disturbance to guests. Overall, however, a global destination and my home away from home. Special thanks to Pav, Ami, Deepika, Trishla, Sumeet, and Vinayak (Dashanzi)."
1235,"Attended hotel for a business meeting had excellent meal option, for the people who are conscious abiut what they eat- there are options of making your own salad with 6-8 types of salad dip, thats totally yummy. It has 2-3 fruit options to choose from. If you are visiting here for your sweet tooth, you can expect some dissapointment, with sweet however the pastries are good. Do try the hotel buffet option its worth. The banquet hall on the ground floor is good."
1236,"This hotel has definitely seen its better days. The check-in was a zoo - crowds of people checking in and out at the same time, front desk understaffed, the welcome refreshing towels and drinks randomly appearing and disappearing (we never got one). The hotel layout is sort of in a V shape, with elevators in the middle, and seriously long trek from the elevators to the rooms.  The rooms are a bit dated, my non-smoking suite had a stale smell of smoke in the living room.  Service varied dramatically - most staff were visibly trying to do their very best (e.g. coping withe the check-in situation), while others seemed a bit jaded.  Overall, I'd probably consider other options in Mumbai in the future."
1237,"The best hotel in town, for work, holidays or leisure... whatever you do in Mumbai have a couple of days at the Marriott Juhu. The rooms are very cozy, breakfast is yummy and the variety of food is just fabulous. Live concert of Indian music during breakfast hours is making your experience so relaxing!"
1238,"Was here for a day just to check out the place and is my second visit. The rooms are awesome I stayed in a club room with ocean view.  BMW Pick Up or drop from Airport. It is quite a busy place and I am amazed how the staff can keep up with every guest. From the front desk and concierge would like to thank Akshaya, Luis , Poojary and Sambhavi. From the gym Rakesh and everyone at Whirlpool and sauna stations, the facilities are very grand and simply amazing. The ocean views are superb too. From Lotus cafe Jazeeb for taking care of me on a busy evening.  The reason for one missing star is 2 fold Upon checkin I had informed reception that my wife would be joining me later in the day and they should have made a note of it. But my wife waited in the lobby while they were trying to"
1239,The Hotel is really good and at the perfect location. The food is brilliant and so is the service. The ambience is perfect to visit with family and friends. The staff is also really helpful and overall a very good experience!
1240,"Beautiful hotel with attentive staff and great amenities.  We were a family of 6 from the UK, first time in India for half the party.  Hotel was a brilliant base with onsite bakery, bookshop, coffee shop, gift shop etc.  Breakfast was amazing with live cooking of everything, from indian food to pancakes to the usual western staples.  Great for fussy eaters or those who like their food!  Rooms - We had an exec room on the exec floor so had access to the lounge - this has the most amazing view of the sea and pretty much 24 hour comp food and drink.  Kids under 12 are not allowed in so it was a chance for the adults to have some peace as well!  Rooms were spacious, with all usual amenities you would expect at this class of hotel...rainfall shower big enough for 2 as well :)"
1241,"I was surprised to find such a bad JW. The only saving grace is the food which is really quite good. The rooms are old and tiny, quite unpleasant. The service is atrocious - the time from when we went to check out till we finally left the hotel was a full forty minutes (by the clock). The excuse they gave was that they had a 200 person convention going on. The restaurants are incredibly dull and boring. The pool-side, while beautiful, is odd where they don't serve anything after 630, not even juice or coffee.  I would definitely would recommend staying here."
1242,"Not too far from the airport (traffic is bad wherever in Mumbai). Lovely location facing sea.  Secure with almost paranoid security screening.  Beautiful grounds and clean rooms. My room didn't face the sea but still Good sized rooms with nice marble lined shower area. All room facilities that you would expect in a 5 star. Decadently ample breakfast buffet with live food stations and buffet spread. With a breakfast so satisfying, you Don't need to have lunch. Pool : cross shaped, is about 30 m , water and pool deck is well maintained and adequate sized to do some laps in mornings - note it gets a bit busier on weekends and in afternoons/evenings.  Highly recommend a stay here. Such a lovely oasis in Mumbai."
1243,"Experience is very good , I visited 2 times with my friends enjoying birthday parties.  We are not booked rooms, or Hotels , we visited for party only , the entrance fantastic   dinning is super , the staff service frendly."
1244,Have been staying at this place for many years now. It is a very good place for a relaxed stay. the rooms are good. the staff and friendly and efficient. the pool is a great place to hang out in the evening and watch the sun set. the lounge has good spread and great people manning it. it is place to go if you have time to enjoy the place. Vini Bachani the FOM is very good at making you feel at home and help with Forex etc.
1245,Good Hotel located at Juhu with lot of restaurant / bars nearby... could be little troublesome while moving to this hotel from the airport during peak hours... good buffet... nice pool.... however little renovations and maintenance would help.... nice bakery... rooms are decent sized... still one of the renowned hotels in Mumbai and you won't be disappointed as long as you don't have to visit the banquets...
1246,Once you step off the streets of Mumbai and enter this JW MArriott you can feel the chaos melt away and true opulence takes place---rooms/staff adn restaurants are all fantastic/also high level os security
1247,"Overall, I loved the mellow vibe of this place. Ivan plays the piano most evenings, located between the lobby + the Lotus restaurant. He is brilliant at creating a lovely ambiance but is also good company to chat to, too.   I also loved the pool area, had a great blow-dry ahead of a meeting, enjoyed a vigorous foot massage by the pool and the hotel helped me organise a brilliant lunch for some contacts. Supper in the Lotus Caf√© and drinks at the Asian cocktail bar were also highlights.   There was one major problem on my first night when a drunk guest in the room opposite mine, kicked up a fuss at mid-night until nearly 2am, shouting in the corridor and banging doors and saying ""I don't care who I wake up"", and I didn't think the hotel handled it at all well. I was very"
1248,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  It is stunning in every aspect. The staff are so professional. The concierge helped us with lots of things, from arranging a tailor to restaurant recommendations. The breakfast was amazing, we had lovely, fresh parantas every morning. I had gorgeous Red Velvet cake at the coffee shop.  The outside grounds are beautiful. The rooms and bathroom were spacious and clean. It's in an ideal location. You can access Juhu Beach from the hotel grounds. It's close to shopping locations etc. We've been around the world and this is one of the best hotels we've stayed in. We would definitely return."
1249,"One of the best hotels I have tried went to Mumbai on a business trip for 5 nights back in July 2011. amazing service the staff well-trained and so hospitable. great concierge arranged everything I asked them a trip to Taj Mahal restaurant reservation meeting room even a wake-up call with the bellboy standing in front of the door with a cup of tea.   A real luxury hotel it is an old Maharaja palace great location close to the airport and major shopping area in front of the beach, lots of F&B options to pick from. the room is well designed and everything is in the right place. I would definitely stay there next time I visit   Pros: -services -location -Room design  -F&B Option"
1250,I have been visiting the coffee shops quite regularly and it is one of the best. Its huge and the menu has a lot of variety and the service is quick.  Perfect place to sit down and relax after partying and do try their chocolate mud cake ...Simply superb !!!
1251,"I had checked into to the Hotel on a Saturday afternoon for what I'm a silver Marriott member, I was being upgraded and they had also given me an executive lounge access for the basic amount I had paid, was a great one night stay overall with a Lavish spread of buffet. I recommend this hotel on the Iconic Juhu Beach."
1252,"The rooms are very spacious, the staff is friendly, the beds are to die for, and the food is delectable! I had an amazing stay here. The only qualm that I can think of is that the rooms aren't very sound-proof. You'll definitely have a problem in playing music loudly."
1253,"Good ambiance, great food and is located on Juhu beach, Very nice property, lot of shopping around, and bunglows of famous bollywood personalities like Amitab Bachan, Hare Krishna temple is also nearby, Airport is also close to this property, nice place to be around."
1254,"Its been a enjoyable weekend with family. From the choicest of welcome chocolates for the kids to the towel art in rooms, the children and we had a fantastic time. Excellent breakfast, superb indian food at saffron, and prompt in room dining. Cant point a finger at anything. Thank you jw juhu team!!!"
1255,"Loved every minute of our stay. Just needed longer to appreciate the hotel more. Very clean, big rooms, lush shower and attentive staff. We were upgraded to a sea view room and were able to checkin early. Can't wait to come back."
1256,"This is a big, busy and very successful hotel in a great location. I stayed there for three weeks and initially found the standard rooms pretty underwhelming. Requests took a long time to get responses and the main restaurant area is vast and noisy. I spoke to a really helpful member of the front desk management called ""Brendan"" who negotiated an upgrade to the Executive floor. Suddenly you're in a different world! It was very expensive to upgrade and I chose to pay personally as my firm only allowed for basic accommodation. The lounge area has a stunning ocean view and I never missed the sunset. Service was immaculate, friendly and always good humoured. ""Mr. Sen' was mostly on duty during my stay and handled every query or problem with professionalism and courtesy. All the"
1257,"Along with three other couples we had an exceptional stay at the JW. Cannot fault the service from start to finish. We arrived early in the morning and the staff generously gave us rooms early so we could rest and freshen up. When we reached our room we had problems with our flush. Maintenance arrived promptly and everything was sorted within minutes. The room was spacious, clean and had a lovely view of the pool/beach. Breakfast was an impressive affair! Such a wide range and choice it was difficult to choose or restrict from indulging! I grabbed a bite from the Bombay Bakery and it was delicious, even a free packet of crisps thrown in that made me feel extra special particularly because I was missing these after being away from the uk! I only wish I had more time to enjoy the"
1258,"I recently spent 17 nights at the hotel on business - long enough to get to know staff and settle in. This is an attractive, well-maintained property, with high standards of security. The staff are consistently keen to be of assistance and go out off their way to ensure that customers are happy. Rooms are cleaned and maintained to a very high standard. The breakfast buffet is extensive."
1259,One of the best rated hotels inn Mumbai. A complete day spent at the hotel and I could feel the richness of the place right from the entrance gate to the lobby...and all the way to the sea facing swimming pool. One thing I felt was lacking was the services related to the event that I had organised.
1260,I went into this hotel anticipating far more than I received.  It's a lovely hotel but extremely busy....there is a lot of foot traffic which takes away from the sense of relaxation and being far from the madding crowd. The rooms need refurbishment in my opinion. The part of the hotel with the rooms in it is quite dated yet the front of the hotel looks more modern. We booked a club room expecting a sea view and more importantly a butler. Unfortunately we got neither. Our view consisted of dry concrete rooftop with view of other disgusting roofs nearby. The saving grace of this hotel is the staff and the service they provide. We were assisted with check in by Phub who upon seeing the disappointment on our faces when we entered our room (mind you we had informed the hotel in
1261,"Wonderful staff, unfortunately the restaurants are letting the stay down. Spices and Arola were one of the best restaurants to dine in. During our this visit the evening food at lotus cafe was so repetitive. Normally, we only dine at the hotel but this time we were getting fed up. Lotus suite desperately needs freshening up.  In a nutshell we have been staying there for many years but the standard of the hotel is slipping."
1262,"I want to acknowledge all of the gym and spa staff of the hotel. They are all extremely polite and friendly. I have spent many months in this hotel and they make me feel like at home.  A special mention to Venkatesh. I spend a lot of time with this great man, who not only has excellent knowledge about health and the body, but most importantly the mind.  He takes the time to ask about my life and is genuinely interested in my well being.   It is because of him I have made huge changes to my diet (recently became vegan- and am stronger, faster, and fitter because of it) and methods of working out and most importantly his encouragement to meditate has drastically improved my health, body and concentration.  Thanks Venky, your a champ."
1263,"Its one of the finest Hotels in mumbai and everytime i go there it gives a memory and a fresh feeling ... love the lobby and the coffee shop, the pool side is so beautiful that you sometimes forget that you are for a meeting .  Met the Indian Actor and a Model .... Dino Morea and had a small chat ... will be back soon"
1264,"We stayed for 2 nights - fab hotel beautiful decor and staff super helpful, friendly and accommodating.   Hotel decor fabulous and very grand.  We had exec club access and the exec lounge is brilliant. Lunch and dinner time they provide proper food so you can endulge and enjoy a proper meal rather than just canap√©s or a few snacks.  They also provide cocktails during the alcohol serving hours which were delicious!   The had an upgrade and the room was very spacious and comfortable. Shower was incredible and we love the amenities provided e.g. Shampoo conditioner etc lovely quality!   Food was delicious- breakfast buffet just incredible so much choice! We also availed of the long dinner option in the evening and again the choice was vast allowing us to try so many beautiful"
1265,"This is a lovely hotel for time off with the family or for that matter for a business stay too. Rooms are large and comfortable and almost all rooms have a view of the ocean, which is very well framed since you have a large swimming pool and a sort of small lake in the foreground and then the expanse of the Arabian sea. Rooms have very comfortable beds and good wifi, with all other amenities that one can expect from a 5 star hotel. Staff are very proactive and in most cases you will be looked after very well. As regards food, stick to the Indian cuisine which is very authentic and the flavors are spectacular. Breakfast buffet has a good spread of international and local flavors. I would give the Italian restaurant (Mezzo Mezzo) a miss. The hotel is frequented by quite a few"
1266,I cannot stop talking about this place and the staff there.  each and everyone was amazing so friendly very personable ready to take care of you from the minute you step out of your car.  the food at the restaurants is great.  I will come here every time i am in Mumbai
1267,This is a very big typical american hotel. Our check in was very bad since we asked for a non smoking room but we got a smoking room to change rooms took hours because going from room to reception back to the room to an other room will take you a long time since the hotel is so big. there was a line for breakfast because it was so busy. Overall the hotel doesn't feels warm or cosy. The swimming pool is nice but stay away when they give swimming class to children (you pay a lot off money to stay in this hotel with pool and for some reason the give swimming class to locals). We also had to deal with a very bad smell coming from the garden which was so bad that staying at the pool was not nice. Overall i would say this hotel is very overrated and that charge way to much money for
1268,One of the best hotels around Juhu beach.  Central located.  Near sea princess hotel. Pleasant view of the beach and you can watch the sun set from your room or by sipping cocktail near the swimming pool.
1269,"This is the place to stay if u want to stay on this side of town. The lobby is very grand. Rooms are good and well equipped. Service five star. One of the best breakfast buffets ever, don't miss it! I always look forward to staying here."
1270,Truly five star hotel from top to bottom  All the staff are very very polite Helpful smiley welcoming  Cannot say enough for this hotel Excellent location Stayed many many times But standard never drop Super breakfast & executive lounge value for money When visiting Mumbai I will not think of any hotel except this one Keep it up
1271,"This hotel is everything you require when holidaying or sightseeing in Mumbai.  It is an oasis in a very busy and sometimes overwhelming city. From the minute you check in the staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble.  The room we had was a superior double room and this was very nice and suited our needs.  The staff maintaining the room were always friendly and obliging.  The room was cleaned to a high standard and the complementary aspects of fruit, daily paper and water were much appreciated.  The only thing it may be better to get upgrade for the better view which would be overlooking the beach and pool area.  Before we visited we had viewed others comments on TripAdvisor regarding breakfast and most were very impressive.  We were not disappointed, the breakfast"
1272,"Booking.com not clear about tax's on final check out discovered even though when booking breakfast is included, you still pay tax on your room separately to you breakfast. If anything additional is purchased I.e mini bar, room service etc all have additional tax's applied. If rate in my case bring Indian rupee changes your booking confirmation amount does not stand you will charged the rate on check out.... awful service when checking out and asking for a breakdown on what all the charges are and why booking.com final price does not stand.  Be careful when booking through booking.com would not recommend it's cheaper and better to either book direct and pay upfront or book through a travel agent so all day/nights charge is clearly set out in black and white."
1273,"Without fail, I always prefer to stay here when travelling to Mumbai. The service has always be exceptional!  If you're lucky you tend to always bump into a celebrity and I personally think the breakfast is the best bit!  Swimming pool is amazing, rooms are always clean.   It's definitely a great choice if you want to stay on the Juhu side of Mumbai."
1274,"Situated on coast side of Arabian sea , nice view from rooms , have wonderful spread out of restaurant and club. Can visit for leisure or business . best place what like is lotus cafe for breakfast , afternoon tea. Infinity pool and huge spa."
1275,"Great hotel....wonderful staff, especially at the reception, restaurants and house keeping. The room was clean and very well kept. The only downer was the layout of the bathroom which was tiny and awkward if you have two people in the room. The restaurant was excellent, the layout, food and staff. I enjoyed all the meals especially  breakfast which had a lot of variety.   My only disappointment was when I requested for a taxi. The taxi came but was given a ridiculous price. There was collusion between the driver and the staff as he told me that the prices were set by the hotel employees. From their actions when I tried to talk to them  I could see it was true. I did not expect this from a JW Marriott facility. I went ahead and paid but never again asked for a taxi during my week"
1276,"I stayed in this hotel three time it very neat and clean with nice lobby smell  Some room with sea side view, it is amazing and room furniture is so good  The breakfast it had variety of choices which i don't see in hotel before"
1277,It feels awesome to be at JW marriott at the night of New Year (31st Dec). Music and food is also good and service of the waiters is Fast. All generation people can enjoy here and have fun. Me along with my frnds always love to be at JW marriott.
1278,"A very comfortable stay. Hospitable Staff. Good Breakfast. Awesome Pool especially, has many banquet halls for all your needs. companies can flow in and have their best time here. good rooms and spacious , costly but luxurious."
1279,"I need a few days alone time in Mumbai while on business. Just wanted poolside relaxation. Got this and plenty more at this hotel. The reception when I landed at 1am was perfect. Attentive, warm and no pressure. I was upgraded to a sea view which was gorgeous. The rooms are very small but gorgeously appointed with very comfortable bed, amazing bathroom. Lots log extra touches with fresh fruit and flower left every day, turn down, water. The buffet breakfast is the most amazing I have seen worldwide. I found the service a little too much as it was morning and the last thing you want is someone every 30 seconds to see if you are ok. What a complaint. The food is magnificent and I for sure put on a pounds. I didn't love the bar as it needs some atmosphere but I'm nitpicking. The"
1280,"This hotel is outstanding from service to the details in the room and he executive lounge. I was staying here due to a canceled flight, our room had a great view of the beach and service was outstanding. Skipped breakfast but ate lunch at the buffet down stairs and was also delicious and the waiting staff went above and beyond in service. The pool area is beautiful but I did not spend much time out there as the smell of fertilizer was disturbing. Another great amenity the hotel had was a fleet of luxury vehicle which we utilized the next day to get to the airport."
1281,airport pick up and Italian restaurant the best. the service is very good here  check in on a saturday afternoon is so slow you have to sit down and wait. there needs to be more staff working   service by the pool so slow that your drinks dont arrive by the time you get too hot and need to leave the pool
1282,A very comfortable stay. Hospitable Staff. Good (not excellent) Breakfast. Awesome Pool especially if it's raining while u go for a dip. The food overall is ok. If you a celebrity hungry kind of person then definitely stay here. You might find a few Bollywood celebs roaming here (go visit the gym :p ). Personally I spotted Jacquline Fernandes and Anil Kapoor (who is a very humble and a super fit guy by the way) during my two day stay here üòäüòá
1283,"I stayed here for 3 weeks while I was working in February and have to say that the service was exceptional. From the hotel receptionist to the waiter at breakfast, I was treated like a queen! It is a beautiful hotel with a lovely pool, spa and gym and great restaurants. The food is exceptional and the attention to each guest is excellent. I loved my room and the little treats I received each day. Such a wonderful stay and the beach is just outside the gate!   There are so many people that I would like to mention for their outstanding service but it would take up the whole review so I will just say thank you to everyone, with particular thanks to Saif at reception for his constant patience and help with my questions, Mohasin for being so attentive at breakfast, Leah for her"
1284,"I travel to Mumbai on business yearly, and have always preferred to stay @ the JW Marriott location in Juhu. Their service is excellent, and the staff are well trained. The management has always exceeded my expectations during my stay in terms of room selection, arranging a car for a day, etc. Additionally, the lotus restaurant breakfast buffet is out of this world. They have over 30 different items to pick from, and you can easily spend over an hour and half munching and trying out different things. In the evenings, the concierge lounge also offers a great variety of food and drinks. The concierge lounge offers an incredible view of the beach, and so do most of the rooms if you're lucky enough to get one of them."
1285,"we stayed there for one week 12th to 19th march 2017. friendly staff, smooth check-in. A clean, well-managed hotel. the breakfast is probably the bestin the world. Well looked after by Chef Mehta, they pay attention to detail. Reshma from guest relations made sure that we were well-looked after. i have stayed there before and hope to visit again soon."
1286,"From my experience the JW Juhu is the finest JW property in Mumbai. The JW Juhu went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. After spending the last 5 months in various hotels across the world I have not had such a high level of service as to what was shown in Juhu. Mr. Pavithran Nambiar leads his staff to nothing but perfection. Everywhere you turn you are greeted with a very welcoming smile and ""How do you do"". Breakfast is delicious with various foods with staff yet again there to push in your chair as you return to your table.   If you are looking for a very comfy and relaxing place to get away from the busy city of Mumbai I would suggest The Juhu."
1287,In 30 years if business travel and 1000s of hotels around the world.  I have never experienced as high of level of hospitality service as at this hotel.From the G.M. to the front desk management to the lounge management and all hotel staff. Very calming property on the beach in Mumbai away from big city madness. This hotel is a gem in Marriott's crown and should be experienced. Best Marriott or SPG option in Mumbai.
1288,"I have a corporate account with JWM in this hotel and since last two years most of my client from UK and Ireland I booked their stay in this hotel. Everyone just love this hotel, from ambience, rooms, breakfast spread, swimming pool, restaurant everything is good.  Staff are excellent and helpful. Most important element is close to beach and you can take walk  early in the morning nice and relax feeling away from noise and pollution. You need to stay in this hotel once to experience it and it is close to International airport."
1289,JW Marriot juhu property located just 3 min away from juhu beach and approximately 4.8 km away from Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport. The room was great which ensure breathtaking view of Arabian Sea with a lovely bathroom. My wife and I booked this property for 2 night stay to celebrate my wife 1st birthday after marriage. We booked this hotel with the help of Bonzo Travel services recommended by one of my colleague. Bonzo Travel Services provide us excellent service which we even cannot imagine. Starting for our Check inn till our checkout. We are happy to be a part of Bonzo Travel Service.
1290,"It didn't feel like 5 star hotel. My hair dryer and teapot didn't work. I had blood stains on my mattress. And stay away from their Asian restaurant. The ambiance is pretentious but the food is awful - this fish was not fresh and was brought with random sides ( not what was listed on the menu) - looked like they use some left overs. And the crows at the pool were very annoying.  The buffet is good, for breakfast or dinner. Staff was very friendly."
1291,"Stayed here for a few days to catch up with friends. Beautiful hotel, great meals - we had breakfast, lunch & room service dinner at various times.  The business lounge was excellent - high tea & evening cocktails were very well received!   Pool area was gorgeous .   All staff were extremely courteous & helpful."
1292,"I never thought a city hotel could be so awesome, but then it's JW Marriott and this one everything right.  The decor is classy, the hotel is huge and the lobby is airy. Flawlessly maintained...right from lift lobby to the pool.  Oh the pool area is lovely.  The rooms are perfect in size, well furnished, have the coziest bed and overlook the pool and the Juhu beach...what more can you ask for.  Breakfast buffet is endless and the service is quick. In room dining menu is quite extensive.  Overall service levels are top notch.   Bombay Baking Company serves the best Danish pastry in town and the cafe Mocha is a must try.  Very few hotels get most of the things right, this is the third one I have seen so far....it's fabulous.  If I really had find a fault, I would say the breakfast"
1293,"JW Marriot is a signature so no two ways about it and this property surely ups the quotient for it for sure. Reminds me a bit of the JW Property in Goa. (A bit  similar I thought, in terms of the inside layout). Great Hospitality, welcome staff and at the heart of the city, people familiar with the Marriot character will surely not go for any other option in Mumbai. This place buzzes with activity and when in Juhu must stay at JWM."
1294,"This hotel is the best Marriott hotel ,the location,the ambience,the rooms and the pool everything is excellent.The food is the best especially the breakfast buffet.The parlour and the disco is amazing.We didn't even have to leave the hotel as, everything was available inside the hotel.Would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone."
1295,"Great staff, clean and delicious food. Close to all locations in Mumbai We had a great experience staying here and I highly recommend this hotel. Looking to be back next year for another visit as we had an unforgettable expreience."
1296,"The hotel provides a break from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.  Security is in place to ensure safety of guests, by reviewing each vehicle and scanning bags as they enter.  Entrance is spacious and provide a view of the garden / pool area.    I will definitely return, even if it is for the service in the buffet area.  Attention to detail when it comes to service set the experience apart.  The team makes the effort to get to know you, example just wanting to make sure they heard correct when I ordered regular coffee and not decaf as I did the previous night....  or setting a dessert spoon in place once I left for the dessert table.  The chef ensured I got butter chicken, when it was not set out as he knew I appreciate it.  It might just be slightly overwhelming to some guests"
1297,"Amazing location, awesome service, great spread of buffet - just love this hotel.  I see few people complaining about the food spread being the same daily, well yes they might think about adding more options. Even the beer options are limited. The executive lounge closes pretty soon - we entered around 10:30 and they said its closed.  Barring these things, I still loved the hotel and its hospitality."
1298,"Ideally located on the beach in Juhu and in close proximity to the market and eateries (chowpatty) - this hotel presents the guest with a perfect experience of Mumbai. Close proximity to the airport helps as well esp with the busy Mumbai traffic. We stayed in the deluxe ocean view room - has a lot of plus' including good view, great service and the executive lounge. Room size is however small (esp compared to taj lands end) and where the hotel struggles is good food. We stayed for 4 nights and by the end I could not only guess the break fast & lunch menu but also pin point blind folded where the dishes would be placed - menu rotation is almost non existent.. could be because it gets a lot of business travelers. The pool however makes it exciting esp for little ones."
1299,"We stayed over the weekend and our favorite part was the dinner at Saffron and the sleep we had in our very comfortable bed. JW Marriott, if you are reading this please reply with details on how we can buy this bed/mattress and all of its coverings. The hotel was nice and freshly renovated and everybody wanted to make you happy. The  pool area also looked very inviting but we had not enough time to use it. What we didn't like were the complicated and antiquated telephones in the room with no way to call the reception desk directly."
1300,"This is one of our favorite hotels and a preferred destination when we visit Mumbai. They always had good service, however, one can now notice that they are trying to make that even better. From the Sous Chef to Room Service personnel and the gym trainer; each was service organization engaged the guests and made the experience a pleasant one."
1301,"Beautiful scenery and the Arabian Sea is fantastic behind this hotel.   Pool is non-alcoholic which I found strange and disappointing.  When you call at-your-service, be prepared to be on hold every time you call. In addition, at-your-service will not take a room service order like all other Marriotts but will pass you off to another hold. Executive lounge is average. Again, you get a great view from the lounge, but limited food and not that great. All in all it is an ok hotel, but not nearly as good as the other JWs in India."
1302,"Nice and confortable hotel . Well situated near the center of the city , very easy to go and visit from there to the most popular places . Staff very helpful and supportive .  The rooms are ok , may be the furniture need some refreshment but still confortable . Nice view ."
1303,We came this hotel for the business purpose. Stay was really amazing we enjoyed our stay a lot. Staff was really helpful specially reception people and housekeeping staff. And also we liked the food as well .
1304,"I landed in Mumbai on an early morning flight. I asked for an early check in. I was promptly given one. And they offered breakfast free. It made such a difference to my day. The room is plush without needless decoration. The service is smooth, no fuss. They know what you need and deliver it quietly. You can focus on your work."
1305,"The distinctive entrance of the JW Marriot is more than just a stunning hotel, it is the symbol of Modern India. It is the service within that really makes the JW Marriott so extraordinary. My recent travels to India was only booked at the most luxurious 5 star hotels and the JW Marriott offered the finest service and experiences throughout right down to the chauffeur service in the top of the range 7 series BMW limo. The highlight of my stay at the J W Marriott had to be the world class dining experience. Well done on extending yourselves to your guests."
1306,"High ceilings, grand vestibule and staircases give quite a grand appearance with views from the entrance through the hotel to the sea. They certainly don't build them like this these days! My room was newly renovated, large and comfortable. Service standards were high and the food in the cafe excellent. Though I gave the hotel 5 stars, it is showing its age a bit. I must say this is typical of properties in the area. The real estate is very expensive but their is little modern development and the beach is miserable. The hotel is very handy to the airport."
1307,"This hotel deserves to be one of the Marriott's flagship hotel. It was fabulous.  Spacious, well appointed and excellent service. The swimming pools catered for children and swimmers. They were well designed and inviting. The food served for breakfast provided extensive choices. The waiters couldn't have been more helpful."
1308,"Amazing staff and service. Very courteous and regarding. Loved the food ,cleanliness,quality.close to the beach. I took the weekend package which was worth the money. The dinner buffet and breakfast buffet were delicious."
1309,"The JW Marriott Juhu is beyond compare. It is elegant, modern with traditional values. You're treated as a VIP the minute you arrive. Front Desk Manager Deepika Kukreja was very attentive and exceptionally accommodating to our requests as we were guests there for 9 nights. She was very professional and approachable.  Our room was beautiful, housekeeping did an amazing job each day. Thank you to Deepak (Manager) and Pravin (housekeeper) for looking after us.  Shefali Qadri was exceptional - from the morning buffet to the evening at the Executive Lounge, she was always upbeat, talkative, and very informative. She was approachable and took good of us while providing the same quality of care to all of her guests. Other exceptional people in the Executive Lounge were Ivan, Swati and"
1310,JW Marriott juhu location is like best near by airport  The hotel construction was little old look then too it was maintain very well  All the new amenities were their  Aromatherapy toiletries were awesome  Food was good  Service was amazing  If u have luck u would see any of the film star their hotel is very popular for stars Even I meet one  I recommend hotel for everyone n take see view room
1311,"The hotel property is very good, with great lobby, dining areas and modern furnishing. Rooms are on the smaller side but cosy. I am a frequent business traveller and when i compare the service at this hotel to any other 5 star category hotels; i was thoroughly disappointed. Service lacked training and courtesy - communication amongst the staff was terrible and food portions miserly. I would not recommend this hotel if you are paying for a great experience"
1312,We have stayed at JW Marriott in Juhu on many occasions and most recently during Feb 2017. Our stay as always had been terrific and very relaxing. The staff at all levels were very hospitable and ensured that our stay was comfortable as well as our needs were met. I enjoyed the gym and the spa facilities. The Lotus cafe and the Reflections bar were fantastic. Executive lounge was also good.  We will go back to JW in juhu again and again as this place feels like our home !!
1313,Stayed for two nights early March. Ended up on the 5th floor facing the pool. Great service from checking in to checking out. Good service at Reflections bar from Wals and his pal.  Clean throughout. We didn't have any food at the hotel so I cannot comment on the menu or dishes. Good location also for many sights and shops. Would recommend getting an auto rickshaw from just outside the hotel gates for quick and cheap rides.
1314,"I have been patronizing JW Marriott for long I stay with them for my business travel. JW Marriott Juhu is definitely miles ahead of other JW in India. The club rooms are good and have all basic amenities but certain upgrades need to be done like I-ports in the rooms are still good for old models, new I-phone cannot be connected to them. Club lounge facilities are fantastic. The morning breakfast in Lotus cafe is lavishly laid out. One can have breakfast of his choice. Rooms with Sea view are great, city view rooms are not recommended unless one gets them for discount."
1315,Never had such great breakfast. They serve even four different types of honey. Good selection of juices from beetroot to carrot and lytchi. Massala chai is a must try as well as made to order dosas and naan.
1316,"I have been staying at the JW Marriott Mumbai for my Business and pleasure trips since 2004 which is once or twice a year. My experience with this hotel has been pleasant 98% of the time. The staff are brilliant and the service is good. The guys at the entrance, to the concierge, to the Lotus caf√©, to the house keeping crew, to the staff of BBC are all fantastic.  I cannot say the same for the front desk crew though. They do not pay attention to their guests ' needs and they seem to be in a hurry for no apparent reason. I find them very unwelcoming and they have no proper answer to any of my questions if any.  But what makes me forget all about the not so good customer service and unlike Marriott standard of the front desk staff is the service I have received from all the other"
1317,"This was our final stop after touring southern India.  We wanted to relax, sleep and eat well.  Everything was wonderful.  The spa treatments were fabulous, the room had plenty of space for the two of us and the food variety was great.  The Italian restaurant was excellent. This was a great place to catch our breath before returning home"
1318,"This was a wonderful stay over New Years. The New Years party didn't look like much fun and was too expensive. The room was great with a lovely bathroom. The Bombay Baking Co had the best Chicken Burrito I have ever had. It was so good that we got it twice in 2 days. The pool was cold, but would be better in the summer time. The Dashanzi restaurant was average and preferred the Mezzo Mezzo restaurant. The staff at the hotel were polite and very helpful. Would recommend this place."
1319,"We stayed here for five days , all i can say is i wished we had more time there.  The service was excellent from checking in to checking out . The staff made our stay like as if we were at home .  Jigyasa Nigam the front desk manager checked us in , made all the adjustments that we needed . All the staff in the executive Lounge made us feel they were part of the family ( samantha, simta & yean ) went the extra yard . The lounge chef ( Senthil)made some mouth watering dishes for us.  The rooms were clean & well kept.  Will be making a return journey soon ."
1320,This was my visit on 24/08/2016 where in they were serving alcohol to some foreigners at 2.00 am  at the coffee shop . Along with the duty manager some of the staff was party to the whole thing .  had objected to the same and due this we had to face abuses from a group of boys . Though I wrote an email to the GM on 31st Aug 2016 mentioning the entire episode till date no acknowledgement of the email.  All customers should be treated alike whether Indian or foreigners. Policies should be the same . Its high time Indians get second class treatment
1321,Have stayed in this hotel a couple of times over the years and every time it feels better then the previous one! The atmosphere is good and the vibes are very positive. The buffet breakfast and dinner was lavish also was treated with a complimentary wine bottle in the evening!
1322,"An incredible hotel where everywhere you go you will feel unique with lots of attention from the staff Beautiful pools , great restaurant , not far from the airport  The executive lounge is amazing with view on the beach and really great food"
1323,"WE last  visited as a one night stopover before flying home a year ago  .The room was fine and we could see the pool and beach but arrived to late to take advantage .As I reported a year ago the evening buffet was one of the finest outside of Vegas and we have eaten in quite a few over the years .We decided that the next time in Mumbai we would book a couple of nights to use the pool etc and to enjoy the extensive buffet . What a change .The buffet had gone from superb to poor and more expensive .The luxury foods (steaks ,prawns ,sushi and many more )had gone and now you only had very limited non Indian choices and these choices looked unappetising .Basically the buffet consisted of cheaper foods that would fill you up quickly ---pasta ,rice ,breads .Or you could have a heaped"
1324,"By far the best hotel we have stayed in India, great quality food, lovely decor in bedrooms and excellent service at all times . A great choice of inhouse restaurants especially Desanzi . Close to all the Bollywood actors residents ."
1325,I always stay here when i fly into Mumbai  The hotel is beautiful and well appointed   The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable.   Electric outlets are well placed and the shower pressure and temperature is perfect  Great pool and and pool deck to take the sun  You can access the beach and if you stay close to the resort you are watched by security cameras.  But be careful the beach has a lot of beggars and peddlers so don't bring any valuables onto the beach   This hotel is a hot spot for Bollywood stars so keep you eyes out as you are bound to see someone while you are there
1326,We stayed here for two nights after visiting one of the best place not India but world (Taj Mahal Palace) so review might be little bias just because of comparison but then both places has it's own identity. Yes rooms were little small in compare to Taj. It's a very busy place with lots of events and mega events that gives you chance if you get luck to rub shoulder with famous names and celebrity and get a glimpse of some of your Bollywood known names. (We did with few and have picture with one of the best music composer in the industry). Breakfast was included in our stay and you will die eating but you won't be able to finish off everything they got. Everything was freshly made and many things made to order. You got variety of foods from four corners of India and around the
1327,J.W. Marriot Ju Hu Beach Mumbai Dear Mr Nambiar My recent stay at your Hotel was simply an experience I will remember for many years to come. I would consider myself to be well travelled; but felt it necessary on this occasion to put pen to paper so to speak to thank yourself and your staff for an exceptional stay. From the smooth efficient security checks on vehicles and people entering the Hotel complex; to the warm welcome afforded by the concierge and front desk was a testament to the Hotels professional standards. This was reflected throughout the Hotel by all members of the staff team. I was personally humbled by people speaking my language and giving an exemplarily service which puts down a marker for others; as I believe your Hotel to be the flag ship for others to
1328,I hated the butter chicken i had in the night here. The price was exorbitant and the quality sucked big time. Also the naans were so rubbery and bad. Extremely poor quality and service for the price asked
1329,"I stayed at the JW Marriott, Juhu for a couple of days during a business trip to Mumbai. I arrived an hour before the check-in time but the hotel staff was very welcoming and checked me in promptly. I was given a room on the 5th floor and escorted to it....the hostess made sure I was comfortable. The room had a partial view of the ocean and it was fantastic. The room itself was very comfortable.  I had added breakfast and dinner to the package while booking so was in for a treat. The breakfast buffet is world class and is a combination of Indian and continental treats...a huge spread.  A temple fest was being celebrated at the restaurant for dinner and was marked by a huge vegetarian spread that had the best of the cuisines of various Indian states. There was an international"
1330,Beautiful hotel the moment you walk in you know it's something special booked the executive room with lounge access rooms modern and spacious breakfast was amazing one of the best look out for shefali she will go out of her way to help you spa was a amazing experience and Yasmeen made sure of that the location with the shops in Santa Cruz and juhu beach and its activities you can't go wrong thank you JW Marriott for a memorable stay....
1331,I have stayed at this hotel many times and it is definitely one of my all-time favourites.  The rooms are scrupulously clean and well equipped and I always get a good nights sleep.  The hotel is right on Juhu beach with great views over the beach and ocean and the pools are lovely. Breakfast is out of this world!  There are more choices than any other hotel I've been to and friendly staff are on hand to cook your favourite omelette or do your eggs just as you like them.
1332,"JW Marriott hotel in Juhu is probably the best hotel you can find in Mumbai with such low prices and high standards /quality. There are several restaurants, each one is has positives . The food is very delicious ! I would recommend staying in this hitel if you are visiting the great city of Mumbai !"
1333,We had an orthopedic conference here. There the food was average plus. But luckily i opted for the general buffet... that was stunning... several sea foods and other options... i was pleasantly surprised and well satiated
1334,"Been here many times and get the same consistent service every time love the restaurants and the variety of dishes in each one of them my favourite is the spice, buffet is also great to have for breakfast"
1335,The Place and momentum is so classy and we have done through triadvisor. We have done lot of enjoy and the hotels boking through trip asvisor is execellent. This is in mumbai near andheri. We enjoy lot
1336,"We stayed here at the end of our India trip from 1/14-17. This review isn't a knock on the quality of the hotel, but their business practices.   If this was a review of just the hotel, it'd be a 5 star review. Accommodating and friendly staff, clean common areas, and a fantastic breakfast every morning. The fitness facilities are top notch as well. We used the steam room every day we were there, even the morning we left. Just a heads up that it's a health club for the locals as well so it can get a little crowded in the mornings. Our room was neat and clean and the shower they have in the rooms are the stuff of dreams. Overall I'd recommend this hotel for any visitors looking to stay in the Juhu Beach area.   Now...the bad side. On 1/1 we got an alarming email from the hotel"
1337,Stayed here for just over a week and experienced all the luxury you would expect from the Marriott. The room was stunning and I had a great sea view. The staff were friendly and there were plenty of facilities on site including some great restaurants and a wonderful hairdressers. The spa was great and the pool areas were kept immaculate and stocked with water and towels. Cant wait for my next visit!
1338,"Mahi in JW Marriot is a perfect party place in Juhu, Mumbai. Nice ambience and great staff made it memorable. It has that eternal cultural feeling as you enter the property. Great place for a corporate / family event."
1339,"Went to this hotel for 2 nights. Arrived about 11ish in the morning, they let us have a room to relax while our rooms got ready. They sent lovely masala tea while we waited which was really needed! The rooms were spacious and had everything that we needed. The staff was a credit to the hotel. Really impressed with the staff. Very polite and attentive. The breakfast was brilliant. Loved it. If you stay in this hotel and if you like sea food I would recommend you go Mahesh lunch house down the road. I would recommend this hotel."
1340,"From the moment you walk into the lobby, pure opulence  The staff is very friendly and always helpful  The selection of wine and spirits at the bar is nothing but top notch (Glenlivet 50yrs old, Johnnie Walker Platinum etc)  The rooms were AMAZING, was impressed to see BOSE wave system, never have had such incredible sound in a hotel room.  Food was delicious and the hotel has several restaurants within.  My most favorite part, the infinity pool, it also has a salt water and a kids pool.  The Buddha structures along the area, and cement lounge chairs in the pool allow full relaxation.  The Gym had incredible staff willing to put a workout together for the day.   Wifi worked without a hiccup !!!  The hotel is self contained and pretty much self sufficient, if business is all the"
1341,"I really have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  It lives up to the JW Brand. The staff are very accommodating and friendly.  They food at the buffet is amazing.  They have a wide range of foods.  I have had the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets. No other place to stay in Mumbai.  The rooms are very spacious.  And the air condition works well for the size of the room.  JW have thought of everything a guest needs and provided it."
1342,"Been a regular visitor for over 12 years to this property.Its always been welcoming and provides the pulse of Mumbai to visitors like me who are non resident Indians.  Ideal location to shopping and other activities .  Service is good ,and have rarely complained ."
1343,"Salud!! üôåüèº The best lake view rooms in the city.. here they are!! , BOmbay baking company at their best ever for quick bites. As soon as you enter.. wooh!! The view is ecstatic irresistible and the best the city could have!! üëåüèºüçæ"
1344,"Had been for a business meeting recently at J W Marriott Juhu. Its elegant interiors, top class coffee shops and hospitable staff is very apt for a business meeting. Though a bit on the expensive side but worth the luxury"
1345,"We have not found one thing to complain about this HOTEL but have numerous wonderful things to say. The Hotel is classy. As we arrived at 6.30am check-in was very smooth as we were the only ones there. A big thank you to Zaif who let us access our rooms straight away instead of having to wait till the official check-in time and he very kindly allowed us a complimentary breakfast. Great customer service, most welcome after a long journey!   This was our first time staying here and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The breakfast buffet is excellent , the rooms are well appointed with a very comfortable bed and nice shower. The hotel is kept very clean. The property itself is very grand and elegantly designed.   The sous Chef, Dvipal Mehta made our day by providing special cake for"
1346,"Probably best hotel I've stayed in Mumbai. Rooms are luxurious and well equipped. Shame the swimming pool was too cold to use comfortably. The hotel feels a world away from the surrounding area. The surrounding area needs a lot of work, and does not feel like the wealthy enclave it is meant to be. The road outside is shabby and dangerous. Perhaps the hotel could have some influence in improving this."
1347,"Me and my husband stayed here for a night and it was an amazing experience. the rooms are luxurious. The breakfast is just awesome. I totally recommend people to have breakfast once in JW if you are in Mumbai, they have a great variety. The best part of our stay was the SPA. Please do book a spa session for yourself. The staff is very professional and we had a great spa experience.  Overall our stay was luxurious!! :) I highly recommend!"
1348,"The Marriott at Juhu beach is nice but probably would struggle to achieve a 5 star rating in many countries.  The room I stayed in was a twin even after booking a king room, it was pitched as an upgrade but we all know it wasn't.  The room itself was recently refurbished by appearance but the cleaning was poor. Scum around floor drain and dried toilet paper on seat of toilet was an instant turn off.  The restaurants: breakfast buffet was included in the room and was great.  I dined at the Japanese restaurant and the food was great, the servers were a little absent and you need to wave to get their attention but I actually didn't mind.   The pool area, it doesn't have a liquor license so if you think that you would like a cool beer on a sticky Mumbai day, too bad you will have to"
1349,"A lovely hotel with staff who really try to do their best for you but I couldn't give this hotel a better rating as there were a few small issues during my stay..  My room was clean & well presented however the noise levels on both nights I was there were extremely high. They had functions/parties on but they don't have sound proof windows so I could hear the music, especially the base, until around 2am both nights. It wasn't a massive issue but it did disturb me a little bit.  I had an issue with the laundry service that took a while to resolve. My company pay for my laundry when in hotels & this was confirmed upon check in. However, the next day when my laundry was ready I was told I had to pay cash in order to get it back. I went to the front desk to resolve the situation &"
1350,A beautiful property in Juhu this has a grand appeal. The look and feel of the hotel is awesome and the restaurant for which one has to take downward staircase has a very royal appeal. Food is very good and rooms are very impressive and modern
1351,"This is my second stay at JW Marriott Juhu and I hope that my next conference in Mumbai will be held again in the same hotel. Love the room, love all the staff, excellent breakfast and dinner buffet. Very good conference facilities including good food, technical assistance and working A/C. The garden and pool is very nice. Easy access to the beach, while not nice for swimming (dirty), good for a walk along locals. Nearby the hotel is exciting temple. Short walk or take tukuk. Coffee shop at hotel sells good coffee and interesting sandwiches. Airport transfers organized by the hotel always worked out well with very comfortable and air conditioned cars and friendly helpful driver. I hope that I can return to this hotel again. I love JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu."
1352,"I like the staff and the rooms very much. However, I can't say the same for the kitchen as if you order from the a la carte menu, it takes them min 30 minutes to cook anything. Very nice view, cosy and clean rooms and polite staff. Would def stay here again."
1353,"I've stayed at the JW Juhu for work and at the end of a recent holiday - it's a lovely hotel with some nice bar areas and a good restaurant. Friendly staff, very nice bedrooms and well-located to head down to more lively areas in Bandra. The pool is a fantastic area to chill if you get a rare sunny day in the city!"
1354,"The JW Marriott is a stunning hotel with amazing staff who can really not do enough for you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by a friendly hello from staff then walking into a grand entrance of this beautiful hotel.  As I said the hotel is beautiful and the facilities are really nice from the pool to the gym the hotel has everything you need, I would highlu recommend  a trip to the Bombay Bakery. The cakes and drinks they offer are stunning.  The staff are what make this hotel, there isn't anything to big or small they wont do for you, from the people who clean you room to the staff just walking around they are so friendly and always have a smile on their face, which as I was away from family on business it made it a bit easier. The in room dining staff were amazing,"
1355,"This hotel is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in! The staff are so very friendly and attentive to all my needs and requirements. The house keeping staff always went above and beyond to make my stay as easy as possible, Mangesh was a star and always made sure I was happy with everything and if I need anything extra. The food was very good and the in room dining service was very efficient and friendly. The hotel is very clean and everyone is so efficient and good at the job/role they had. At the pool the staff were very good and always on hand for everything. Sachin always help me with my towel and sun lounger to make sure I had everything I needed. All in all I was away from home and normal comforts out of reach, I was made to feel relaxed and a home away from home"
1356,It used to be much better the Lobby smells of eggs and food all the time after 2 days it become unbearable  the hotel in the evening becomes boring and nothing to do there no entertainment at all   I had few issues in breakfast hall I asked for table which was empty they told me it was reserved then I ask for another one they said it was reserved as well which was strange SO I ASKED THEM TO BOOK IT FOR ME TOMORROW  THEY SAID THEY CANT WHICH MEANS THERE IS NO BOOKING OR RESERVING   SYSTEM AND THE TABLES WHERE EYMPTY TEILL I Left  so No one came for reserved tables  I left by 11 am which is the time they close I REALLY FELT BAD AND UNSATISFIED  rooms ok matters was overused as well as the pillows but housekeeping was great  and Mr jazib  Hussain was really nice and helpful     Gym
1357,"Its 10 years since I stayed at JW Marriott at Juhu Beach Mumbai. The hotel is so much different now with a athmosphere of the genuine India empire. I had a seaview room, and the view is amazing. Rooms are nice and bed very comfortable. Breakfast buffet is great, but the japanese tapas resturant is a most visit place. Wow, what a dinner I had, and so delicate presented.  General score: 1 socs 10 amazing  Location: 10 Price: 5 Food: 9 Service: 9 Room: 8 Pool; 8 Bed: 9  Looking forward being back"
1358,"Overall a good hotel with great service. Rooms are clean, modern and well maintained. Staff is always very helpful and attentive to your needs. Great gym which is nice when you travel with staff that can help with training if needed. Only ate at the buffet restaurant for lunch once but very good choice if Indian and International dishes and all very good quality. Hotel has a beautifully landscaped pool area which I haven't had the chance to enjoy yet. Lots of good restaurants close to hotel as well. Overall a very good place to stay in Mumbai and only 15 to 20mins from airport....depending on time of day."
1359,"I have had so many positive experiences at the jw marriott juhu and have written do many positive reviews in the past about them and also bombay baking company within the hotel, that's it's painful to leave a negative review. Sadly however, they have taken more from my credit card than my receipt shows they were supposed to take and I feel violated as a result. I used my UK credit card to pay for numerous meals at the lotus cafe and the bombay baking company within the hotel (meals were good) and I elected to pay in Indian rupees as advised by my credit card company. This is because the amount in rupees then gets debited from your card at the banks exchange rate on the day and not at the merchants own rate (which is usually far worse) if you elect to pay in pounds. Despite my"
1360,After staying at the JW sahar I had high expectations for JW Marriott Juhu and they definitely were not met. The rooms are old and tiny. There is hardly any space to place your suitcase. The service is decent but not great. Upon checkout we were informed that we must pay for Internet even though we are Marriott rewards members. After calling Marriott this was resolved and our money was refunded. This hotel wants to charge for everything and cheat customers out of their money. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1361,"Stayed here in January 2017 as a early birthday treat whilst travelling India. The location was amazing, it was on the beach and close to main attractions that we wanted to visit. The first room we were offered was on the lower floor and wasn't the nicest of rooms, we had asked to change and this was done within the hour. The second room was lovely with a partial view of the sea!  The power shower was great and I like the extras they gave in the bathroom - the mouthwash is a great touch!  We dined at the Italian and the Indian at the restaurant. The Italian was really nice but the cocktails weren't so great and as it was my birthday they bought a cake out but I was highly allergic to it even though I had stated I had a nut allergy, the waitress stated she ""thought"" it did not"
1362,"Getting there: Arrived at 4am and we took a pre-paid taxi arranged before you exit the airport . It cost RS1400 for 3 adults and a child with 4 large suitcase and 3 carry-ons, so we needed a large people carrier. About 15 mins drive.  As we arrived at 4am check-in was very smooth as we were the only ones there. A big thank you to Akshay who let us access our rooms straight away instead of having to wait till the official check-in time and he very kindly allowed us a complimentary breakfast. Great customer service, most welcome after a long journey!  This was our first time staying here and as with the majority of reviews we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The breakfast buffet is excellent , the rooms are well appointed with a very comfortable bed and nice shower.  The hotel is kept"
1363,"The hotel offers one free airport pick up or drop off. I haven't been to India in 12 years and was shocked the car had free WiFi!! They told us to get a car outside the hotel for the return back to the airport, it was only $5 USD. The hotel and grounds are beautiful! Very clean and fresh. Unfortunately the beach is extremely dirty and the pollution on land and in the air is horrid, my husband and I got sick from the smell of plastic burning from the garbage fires that are constantly burning in the area.   We got to the hotel very late in the evening and the restaurant downstairs was still open, I believe it is 24 hours.  Food was good and it was nice to have a drink after a full day of traveling.  Their breakfast buffet was plentiful with lots of options. One thing to remember"
1364,"This is probably Marriott's best hotel is India. The location on Juhu beach, one of the best beaches in Mumbai makes this property even more attractive. As you walk through the lobby , you will be amazed by the stunning view of the ocean in front of you as well as the hotel's  internal architecture and decor. This hotel offers the best of a beach resort and an upscale business hotel, with service to match. We were most impressed by the service, staff and restaurants. All in all a wonderful place to stay in Mumbai."
1365,"Had a wonderful stay here for four days. The rooms although a little on the small side were clean, bright and extremely comfortable. The breakfast is one not to be missed, so many different varieties. I doubt you would find something you don't like.  Dashanzi has some of the most amazing food I have ever tasted, it was that good we had to get a doggy bag. I would highly recommend the edamame infused tofu. The spa was amazing one of the best massages I have ever had, however the wait time was a little too long.  All of this has been ruined by the awful customer service i have received. upon check out. There was some confusion, and I was charged for my cousins room. This was I thought cleared up, until i got home and saw I was charged for two rooms not one. thinking this could be"
1366,"We have not found one thing to complain about this HOTEL but have numerous wonderful things to say. The Hotel is classy and thanks to the front desk Manager (Siddharth Chitnis) we were given room no # 148 which has a lovely sea view - there is no need to go anywhere from 5.30pm to 6.30pm but just sit in the room, sipping coffee or a drink from the minibar and watch the sun going down.  Breakfast is fit for a MAHARAJA and don't forget to try the freshly baked crossiants (as they come out from the adjacent oven).   The sous Chef, Dvipal Mehta made our day by making us the WORLDs best Channa Bhatura. Unlike normal Bhaturas, the ones made by Dvipal are well-fried, crispy and thin on BOTH sides."
1367,"This is my 1st visit to JW Marriott Juhu (stayed at Taj Land's End 10 years ago). The welcome, check-in and room assistance were great. We ate dinner at Saffron and received an amazing service. Thank you for making our stay wonderful."
1368,"Mistake to come and dine at the Lotus cafe at Dinner Time. Service Poor, Chef Amar Singh quite unhelpful and unwilling, bad options, bad quality of food, high priced and staff uninformed of what they are serving.   Simple thing of asking chef to make something non spicy got a cold response.   Too many managers and yet no care to make dining experience better.   Avoidable"
1369,"This is the review of our last stay in J.W.Marriott, Juhu in Feb. 2016. It was our annual trip to India.  Our stay was excellent this year too. We are writing this review of our stay , to thank the people involved in making it so pleasant!  At the front desk, we were checked in by Mehul .He made sure all went smooth and made things very convenient for us, throughout the stay. Very friendly and polite! Gaurav at the front desk also helped us and always enquired about our wellbeing ,during the stay.  The Lotus Cafe.....our favourite spot in the hotel,there were so many here whose service and hospitality deserve a special mention.  Rudolph, Sohum ,Aniket, Pranav & Nilesh ,Sunny stood out for there friendliness. Special mention to Avinash and Krupesh...it was a pleasure to be seated"
1370,Fantastic hotel rooms and service was also excellent. The breakfast at lotus cafe was awesome delicious and yummy. The lounge was also good. Overall the stay was very good. If you are a foodie you will like this hotel and the restaurants.
1371,I have stayed in JW Marriott 3-4 times and always bumped into lot of Bollywood celebs.Its a huge property right on famous Juhu beach.Rooms are of good size and verg well furnished. Marriott breakfasts are always good with lot of varieties.This time I had taken half board which included my dinner also.Huge variety of desserts were amazing. Gym and swimmimng pool is also not to be missed.
1372,"I will brief in the following points:  1- check-in took around an hour ! 2- The room is not insulated and there is no sound proof. You cannot sleep at night !  3- quite rooms are the one at the end of the corridor. You have to walk long distance from elevator.   4- food in the buffet was good in the past , now less variety .     5- staff not friendly.   6- old decoration. Wallpaper in many locations are teared."
1373,"Staff is exceptional.  Will do anything for you.  Restaurant in club served us after closing hours.  The chef downstairs packed us a special lunch to go.  The waffle maker at the Sunday brunch outdid himself, as did nearly everyone else.  The spa and swimming pool were also wonderful.  We did our best to fit in a weeks worth of activities in a 24 hour stay.  Highly recommend it.  The only glitches were trouble with the key fob to our room that didn't always work in the elevator or room door."
1374,"It was an amazing experience it is not possible to leave the place bored. I highly recommend it and would definitely want all of you to have a pleasant stay. I very good and ideal place for someone to stay or have a meal at JW MARRIOTT, JUHU"
1375,"This was my second time at the Marriott. My first visit was in March 2016. This hotel was full for NYE holiday makers so was very busy. You couldn't really tell this though. Again, welcome at the front door were very polite and welcoming.  I was very annoyed at the gentleman (named Wasim I believe) who checked me and my husband in. He was very polite to my husband and then pointed to me and said ""is this maam staying with you?"" I, angry at that point replied, ""where do you think I'm staying?"". He ignored that and carried on.   We had a sea facing room which was cool but the design of the room is terrible!! The whole contemporary design of the bathroom was just wrong. The sliding doors are a nuisance. The bed was very very uncomfortable! We asked for the mattress to be changed"
1376,Wonderfull place in the hectic city of Mumbai. The JW is really a great place to relax after a busy day in Mumbai. The room are ver spacious and modern and are equipped with everything you need. The restaurant offers a great varity of food. The bar is not the ultimate place to be but ok
1377,"Stayed for one night at the JW Marriott Juhu. Requested an upgrade to a suite on the basis of Gold status, which they very graciously obliged. We received the Executive Juhu Beach Suite which came with a spectacular view of Juhu beach (even from the bathtub!), a small selection of indian sweets and plenty of space to relax.  The property itself is very grand and elegantly designed. A  swimming pools and a beautiful and well maintained lawn."
1378,"I had my stay at marriott on 25th Nov 16.gud rooms with nice sea view. Gud and fast service for any support requests.Only negative which I felt was, no one accompanied me to the room after heck in.checking in solo without prior booking felt like a crime from the face of receptionist.also had a key problem where I was not able to open my room with the card..later it was resolved...but such negatives are least expected from Marriott....anyway. . Totally good....my second second stay in marriott ..."
1379,Due to a missed connection stayed at this place. Wish i had taken some pictures. The rooms are amazing - very large and the convenience of staying close to the airport.  The restaurant served buffet dinner which had a good spread of food - had never tasted lamb and chicken pickle!!
1380,"This is my absolute favorite hotel to stay in. They really do everything right from beginning to end. The service is wonderful. Check in was very fast and they upgraded me to the presidential suite being a gold elite member. The room surpassed all my expectations. To take a bath while looking out on the Arabian see at sunset was blissful. Saif took great care of me, printing boarding passes, getting me check in right away, etc. Being a Westerner, Americans area always worried about what kind of bed they are going to sleep in, is it clean and how is the food? In all areas JW Marriot excels. The lobby has a wonderful atmosphere, the beautiful art exhibit by Santish Gupta was inspirational. I love the flower bed displays on the stairs heading down to the lower level. When you head"
1381,I have visited this hotel a few times now. Please be warned that the standards are slipping ! . I have been in touch with the hotel to discuss the exact issues. They obviously cannot fix what is in the past but let's hope they can improve!
1382,The cusine of the hotel jw Marriott is very tasty and mouth watering ....The room is better and the view from the room is great .The staff is well behaved . It is nice and great hotel love to visit again
1383,"My review is based on my recent stay Dec/2016 to Jan/2017 at this hotel in Mumbai. Started my stay on 31/2016 with no bedding provided for 2nd adult even after booking their suggested expensive suite due to new year celebrations excuse.  Lights and a/c in the room were broken and could not be fixed after repetitive complaints and visit  by their engineers and had to sleep in cold and bright rooms through out my stay. Even the basic food from menu could not be provided for e.g. French fries, yogurt, coconut  water due to out of stock excuse. And most of the time took a minimum of 45-60mins to get any food on the table. All types of breads were beyond consumption unless you like chewing gums type breads.  Miscommunication between management and staff resulted in food/chocolates"
1384,The hotel was decorated beautifully and as always the breakfast was amazing.  I had enough down time to watch the birds from the executive lounge and it was mesmerizing.  What a nice place to have a drink and watch the water and the beach.
1385,We had excellent stay at JW Marriot last month while on our way back to Ahmedabad from south. We found entire staff of the hotel very helpful courteous & very well mannered as they were always ready to help us anytime anywhere. Our check-in was delayed by 45 minutes as room was not ready but to compensate the delay we were offered complimentary tea -coffee at coffee bar (BBC) opposite reception. We were also given complimentary bouquet & cake on our marriage anniversary which we never imagined. Fitness center is also very nice. Also one can find lots of eateries nearby the hotel if you want to try  outside food. We would like to repeat our stay any time in future.
1386,Visited in December - had nice sea facing rooms.  The hotel has an extensive lobby area which was beautifully decorated.  Lovely pool and spa area next to the gym. A wonderful selection of food for buffet lunch.  Staff polite and helpful.
1387,"Positive - Very friendly staff specially Priynaka at the front offic. Room was well maintained and shower pressure was great.  Negative - I spent about 100,000 INR and at check out was assured my points will post the same way as it posts in the US. However its not yet posted. I have been chasing the US customer service who in turn are awaiting invoices from the hotel as they do not have access to online invoices. I did send a scanned copy of the invoices I have. I have written to JW in Mumbai for the same but they happily ignore my email. I am a platinum elite member  who stays at Marriott almost every week and I would easily get 20,000 points for my spend but I doubt I will get it. For this very reason I do not l am to every staying here again. If I am not going to get points I"
1388,"Superb ocean view rooms, large infinity pool, centrally located. Good service, Good veg and Biryani and nihari at Saffron Lovely lamb chops at Dashanzi Good Italian at Mezzo, lamb chops again, pizzas and tiramisu A large buffet. Cold stone ice cream recommended Spices for good Chinese, dimsums Good breakfast choices"
1389,"Our favorite here is the breakfast buffet on a Sunday.  The spread is unmatched and needs to be enjoyed at leisure. Having been there more than a dozen times, I still do not get tired of the spread.  I normally begin with some fruit and juice, followed by some fresh bread and cheese; before walking around and checking the live counters. Once the survey is done, then the actual session begins - a crisp dosa, puri sabzi, parantha, washed down with juice or coffee, a bit of relaxing before the eggs, sausages, fresh bread/toast is tried out.  And finally some java with sweet bun and preserves to round it off."
1390,"Had the occasion to spend some time in coffee shop of JWM. Very good service, courteous staff, excellent varieties of tea for breakfast & afternoon & evening teas. Lobby is very well decorated with sculptures of Shri Satish. The hotel is very well decorated for welcoming the New Year."
1391,"This was my second time staying at the JW Mariott,the first time being about eight years ago. The hotel has not changed much since then in terms of the lobby and decor but everything has been well maintained. The hotel is impeccably clean even though it was at full capacity.   The rooms are a bit dated but are clean and very comfortable.   The breakfast at this hotel is out of this world! So many options,it's often difficult to choose as all the options look and taste really good. South Indian breakfast, English breakfast, healthy options, waffle station, cake station, fruit..you name it, they have it. My only compliant would be that the service in the restaurant was not as good as it was a few years ago. We had to ask for items a number of times. However, the restaurant was"
1392,I was here for 4 nights with my wife and I had a great experience. The breakfast was absolutely amazing and the food at Saffron was great and the service too. Must recommend this property the spa and the pool is fantastic.
1393,"I am typing this message whilst staying at the property! I must be eager to get this message out.  If your considering this hotel then be warned:  You cannot be served any alcoholic drinks in any of its outdoor facility, i.e. THE SWIMMING POOL (in fact that is the only outdoor facility on offer). This alone has ensured that'll never come back.  The rest of the hotel is much of the same as any other decent hotel. It does not offer anything that would blow your mind. Actually it's incredibly boring.   The breakfast is the same as any other hotel that rates above 3 stars throughout the whole of India.   The wardrobe space in the premier rooms are pathetic. The AC unit is adjacently above the bed. It's louder then it should be, so much so it disturbs my sleep.  I know this review is"
1394,"We had one of the higher class of bookings but were further upgraded to an Executive Suite and it was one of the 'sweetest' experiences I've had. My wife and I were en-route on our Honeymoon and this was a perfect beginning of our trip that we could have asked for. Cake, flowers and a personalised note from hotel staff, access to the executive lounge throughout, room and sea view to die for, room cleanliness near to perfect and professional and courteous staff wooed us throughout. There were few minor hiccups like weighing machine in the room not working, minor stains on the beddings, some rustiness in the room here and there and chaos at the Lotus cafe during breakfast but they didn't matter much in the larger scheme of life. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay!"
1395,Big and beautiful hotel with many rooms..so you might face problems in reaching the ocean facing room since are far from the lift. service is very slow.. checking in took around half an hour. Very slow room service. Huge line for the breakfast.. May be it was too crowded coz of Christmas eve but they shud have managed. overall ok experience.
1396,Everything at this hotel was amazing during our stay. We stayed October 8 through October 12 with a late check out. The airport transportation from the hotel was via a BMW 7 Series and the driver was very professional.   The breakfast at this hotel is superb and love the instrumental Bollywood and Indian music playing.  We stayed during the holiday Durga Puja season and the festival was walking distance from the hotel.    We had a great time shopping at the book store and found a wonderful children's book about India which I brought back some copies to the US.  I love swimming in the swimming pool and walking to the beach was easy from the hotel.    The JW brand is spectacular in India and I'd surely come back to this superb property again.
1397,"Stayed here between Dec. 20-25. Have been staying here for last few here, but the Dramatic improvements with landscaping facing the sea / F&B services.The Menu @ Lotus Cafe has scope for improvement.  Front Office / Concierge Desk excelled in their services. Special mention of Mr. Abhijeet, Siddarth Chitnis and Kyle. All respect for the general manager who does a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality!"
1398,Excellent location on the Juhu beach with beautiful swimming pools and garden. Executive lounge is excellent with service par excellence and large selection of good food. A busy hotel with many bollywood clientelle and tourists. Excellent housekeeping service. Hotel has excellent gym with trainers but personalized training may be difficult to find due to large number of guests.
1399,"this was the first time we stayed here, rooms are great, locations is pefrect , room service is to another level.... love to go again here next time... we also enjoyed all the spa services provided for house guest again..."
1400,"This property might have once been a princely JW, but not anymore. Rooms are outdated (ie - broken weight scale, plugs, etc.), the resort is showing age throughout, facilities are subpar compared to other 5-star resorts/hotels in the city.  Compared to the the newer JW near the airport, this hotel is subpar in every way. The only benefit is arguably the location, but honestly even that ends up being worse during traffic hours (which is half the day in Mumbai). The executive lounge offer a paltry selection of dinner entrees in comparison to JW Sahar. In traffic time, it takes longer to get the Juhu than it does to JW Sahar from South Mumbai and even Bandra (makes no sense, but it does).  For a business stay, absolutely choose JW Sahar. For a pleasure stay, choose JW Sahar unless"
1401,"I stayed here on business and was given an executive room although the view of the beach was rather obscured as I had a corner room, hotel is very modern in style and the bedroom reflected this with bathroom that was integral to the room, bed very comfortable and room facilities good.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  I had access to the executive lounge where complimentary food and drinks were included, with the provision of breakfast afternoon tea and canap√©s and drinks including alcohol during happy hour in the evening ( which was more me like a buffetm  than snacks) I didn't need to buy any food or drink during my stay so it is certainly worth considering upgrading for this.  The main restaurant had a very wide variety of food choices but was so large that it felt like"
1402,"The trip was awesome at jw we had a fabulous experience staying at this hotel, the staff is cordial and ready to take any requests. We will b visiting again soon.thank you once again. Perfection is the word."
1403,"A very short (1-night) stay in December 2016 at one of Juhu's most prestigious hotels. Being a Marriott Rewards member and also a staff member at one of Marriott's program partners, I was entitled to a special rate, which was quite attractive. The booking process (done directly online through the Marriott website) was fairly simple. I was also entitled to a 2-way airport transfer as a part of the package, so on requesting, the hotel readily offered an airport pickup. A uniformed chauffeur from the hotel was waiting in the arrivals hall of the Mumbai airport with a spic-and-span, state-of-the-art Audi A6 for me. Check-in was quick, as it was 5:00 AM and the reception was pretty empty. Room was very impressive, although a little outdated. I was allocated a room with a partial sea"
1404,The property is well over a decade old but still continues to maintain the new feeling.   A huge lobby with great variety of restaurants and stunning swimming pool really sum up to make this one of the preferred hotels in Mumbai.   Dashanzi is their new pan-asian resto-bar which you should try out.   BBC is a must for cake and sandwich lovers.
1405,"When we arrived we were welcomed warmly by the staff and in time for our visit there was an art exhibit with some boddavistas...We met the front office manager aptly named Siddharth, who with his staff ushered us to the lounge while they got our room (an upgrade) ready. The staff in the lounge were charming and very helpful... Widely exceeding our expectations. The food in the breakfast  buffet was incredible as was Saffron restaurant . Great place to relax before leaving India. Well done to the GM for assembling such a team!!"
1406,"It was one of the most beautiful scene I have seen on seaside Ambiance was good. And staff of the hotel were very good and professional. Well, it was good to stay. Overall four and half stars I can give."
1407,"We arrived in Mumbai and proceeded to the JW Marriott at Juhu, the check in process went very smoothly. We had 2 rooms and they were able to put us next to each other. Since we arrived around 11:00pm we decided to have a light dinner in the coffee shop. The kids ordered a pizza and we had some kababs & beer. The food was good & the beer was cold!!! We spent 3 nights and the service was wonderful. The rooms were clean and the attendants did a wonderful job.  The breakfast buffet is amazing...  Something for everyone.  One night we didn't have the energy to go out for dinner, so we enjoyed some wonderful Indian food at Saffron, located downstairs in the hotel.   Look forward to visiting this great hotel again!!!!"
1408,We had there best lunch ever!!! :)  Wonderful lunch buffet spread with amazing choice of foods and condiments (loved garlic achar!!). Chefs were doing amazing job. It is difficult not to overeat there :) This all finished off with a great coffee and my favourite fruits really made for a memorable last lunch in India on our trip and was worthy every penny.
1409,"as expected probably the best hotel to stay in in terms of service, and location. Amazing breakfast with every cuisine imaginable and very friendly staff who can do no more. We got upgraded to a Garden-View room which really is the best. The restaurants and drinks are a bit on the expensive side and disappointed that the night-club is no longer there. Locally excellent attractions and the beach ... all perfect!"
1410,"As a lifetime Platinum with Marriott, I want a hotel that is convenient and caters to business needs. Fast internet, spacious rooms,nice lounge with responsive staff. The JW was great. Responsive team, good services in a dynamite location. Doesn't hurt when you see the glitzy Bollywood types walking through the lobby. A great stay."
1411,"We stayed at the Marriott in November with my 86 year old mother in law who is frail and needs ongoing support. We had booked two non smoking club rooms more than 6 months before our arrival and paid in full. Given my mother in laws needs, we had requested interconnecting or rooms next to each other. This request had been reconfirmed on the morning of our arrival and we had been assured that it would be met. However, on arrival , we were allocated two rooms quite some distance and smoking rooms as well. We complained but were told that nothing could be done as the hotel was full. Our frustration, which lasted over an hour and we had exhausted elderly to cope with as well, was only resolved when Akansha Sen took over the case and upgraded to a suite next door to my mother in"
1412,The service here was amazing. From the driver that picked us up at the airport - even the cars have wifi! To the welcome we got when we arrived at the hotel. The manager greeted us and took us to our room. The free breakfast in the morning was GREAT! The gym was nice and had new equipment. We also had a free cocktail hour at night. I would definitely stay here again.
1413,"This hotel provides great service. Our room was top notch and very clean and comfortable. It was cleaned daily to a high standard. The room temperature was on the cooler side and playing around with climate control interface did not seem to increase the temperature. A prompt call to housekeeping was made, their promise to send an engineer to look at the issue never came to fruition. It's clear they need to improve their communication levels.  Their buffet breakfast was simply superb."
1414,"I will say that I have been staying at the JW Marriott in Juhu in several occasions for the last 4 years, but I have noticed that the quality of the services have started to decrease from 5 to may be 3 or 2 starts. The main areas that the upper managers have ignore are overcrowded executive lounge, allowing over night parties in the rooms, the same type of food in Lotus Cafe every single day, lack of proper training to the staff, rooms not clean properly and in some cases managers ignoring any recommendation or suggestion being made. I liked the view, it is a nice facility but management need to improve the quality of the staff."
1415,"One of the best hotels in the city, located in a prime location. The food here the the 'lotus cafe' is delicious and the rooms are just exquisite. Its not too far from the airport, and is located along the beach side."
1416,"Spectacular place to be. Greeted by very friendly staff. Lots of in house restaurants. If you can afford it try and get an upgrade to the executive room which is located on the 4th floor of the hotel-you can have it sea facing and swimming pool view (as per my pictures from my room). It's very luxurious room and room service is of the first class. With this upgrade they offer privileges such as:   1. Executive lounge 2. Breakfast 3. Highs-tea 4. Pre-Canap√©s 5. Cocktail hours 6. Complimentary Tea,coffee and soft beverages  7. Complimentary wireless internet station 8. Complimentary Boardroom facility 9. In house library 10. They provide transport to the airport one way.  All these above privileges have a set timing when you are allowed to use them or set timing when they start"
1417,Stayed at the JW Marriott for the 10th year running. Was with my two young boys as my wife was travelling on business to the States. Had some initial problems with the room but these were immediately sorted out by Siddarth Chitnis who in my eyes is an exceptional Front Desk Manager. We were given attention and treated as special guests including a free upgrade for the issues we had faced. Will be visiting again.
1418,"One of the best hotel in Mumbai, i love ·π≠o visit, the space and rooms and amazing. I can strongly say that whoever plan to visit JW, cab go and book, specially food and the hospitality was good. I love it.."
1419,"This hotel was well located on Juhu Beach. The staff were very attentive and helpful. The hotel arranged for us to have a driver who was very polite and always on time and knew all the best places to shop (I went for my wedding shopping).   The restaurants all served amazing food, and the breakfast is by far one of the best selection I have ever seen at a 5 star hotel!   I will be back again soon!   NB - ensure that you claim your free one way transfer to the airport with the hotel!"
1420,"One of the best place I have ever been , the swimming pool is so beautiful from the pool it looks like it is connected to the sea amazing it is , the food from the coffee shop was ossump staff was very helpful and attentive ,good place to visit"
1421,"Huge hotel, building seems very new Clean, nice room, rate is in line with other ( about 170 usd including breakfast) If you need to take a meal, the main restaurant buffet is very expensive and you have nothing next door, walking distance. Room is large, nice bath and shower All what you may need in the room!  Hotel is Convenient if you are in transit. Has a shuttle"
1422,"This is a lovely hotel no doubt.  Grand lobby and wonderful spiral staircase to the dining room. The brakfast is fit for a queen. 6 varieties of fresh fruit juice. Good and ripe fruit. Let down by the cumbersome paratha order system. Just too complex. Why not have some paratha ready cooked so people in a hurry can get on. Too much service is a bit like salt, does not enhance the dish.   Rooms are nice, but getting left behind with more modern offerings.  Mark some power points that stay on all the time so your PC continues to charge when you are out with your key card. Housekeeping are very good, nothing is too much trouble. Best in class bed sheets, such smooth cotton.  Have a cocktail at 6.00 pm and watch the sun go down, still remember that treat."
1423,"As a frequent guest of the Lotus Cafe, I must say that the food is fabulous but the experience after a Sunday brunch is the worst. On more than 3 occasions now, I have had to wait for my car for over 45 minutes which is not acceptable. On further inquiry I was told that the valets had gone for their tea breaküôÑ. Please make visiting your hotel a complete experience. Valets are also rude like they are doing you a favour rather than their job. Kindly look into the matter as I think I am not the only person who has face this problem."
1424,We got as we expected both in terms of service and food quality. Our stay was equally pleasant. I would strongly recommend this. The rooms are good and large. Each room has a unique view and offers picturesque.
1425,It's a JW. Not sure there's more to say but here goes. Staff is very helpful. Breakfast spread is phenomenal. Rooms are nice. Bathrooms are ok - only because a bit dated with the old Juhu marbled bathroom shower theme
1426,"The Marriott offer quality business accommodation in the city, the rooms are well equipped  and a nice size .   Built around the pools it gives a tranquil set up to the bustling city outside   It has a well equipped gym and a wonderful spa as well . Would definitely recommend this hotel"
1427,"The hotel is by far one of the best i stayed ever. Few might find it a bit pricey , but being a 5 star, the facilities provided are worth it. Be it a breakfast or brunch buffet, food is above excellence. The staff is very keen to serve you & very polite with the customers. The rooms we stayed are exceptionally clean. All our requests were handled in a very professional manner. Will make sure to take up a stay every time in Mumbai."
1428,Initially was given a bad room that smells - was promised an upgrade since we are gold elite members - no response. We complained about the smell / odor in the room - then were moved to different room. The executive lounge is good - but food during happy hour is slow in refilling - too many people - need to check/control for authorized residents only. Staff overwhelmed. Services is spotty.  New Asian Restaurant is good - reasonably priced.  Lotus Caf√© where the breakfast menu is great. Good Service. Overall this hotel is good - but needs good remodel - access to juhu beach from property is great. The pool is good. The staff is great.
1429,It is a great property on Juhu Beach. The reception staff was nice enough to give our room at 1 PM. Thanks Shivambhi. The suit was excellent right in front overlooking beach. The bathroom was quite big with beach view. The property is maintained very well. There was a big improvement in service compare to last year. The food  at Saffron was very good and so was breakfast at Lotus Caf√©. The spa was great. Thanks Karuna and Thumo. There was some problem in the night. Some party was going on at a small banquet hall with very loud disco music. It looked there were no proper sound proof equipments in the hall. Due to this our room on 3rd floor was literally vibrating. It was only after makinf two complaints at 12.30 and 1 the volume was reduced. I don't know how the management was
1430,"Me and my friend went for the buffet dinner at the Lotus Cafe in this hotel. Although the selection was fairly good, we were not happy with the service. There were plenty of waiters hoovering around or chatting with one another, but not being attentive to the diners. I had to call them several times to remove the plates piling up on our table. When I asked for a 'Gulab Jamun' ( An Indian sweet dish), the waiter brought this on a messy, untidy plate. Nothing wrong with the ambiance, but the waiters are not properly trained...that's all."
1431,Stayed at the JW Juhu on 21st and 22nd.  I would like to review my experience in bullet points as below: Check in- Seamless check in taken by Sarfaraz though earlier he said i didnt have a booking (my Bro and I were on double occ from 21st).  Room- The room was with an Ocen view with all the basic facilities.   Couldnt ask for more.  Breakfast- one of the best in town with good service.   Though on one occassion i was served a wrong egg order and the correct order came sans the chicken sausage.  But never the less the Staff and Chefs do a commendable job catering to the Guests requirements.   Chef Rishad needs a special mention here.  During dinner I asked for cheese cake but was informed that Blueberry compote was not available so was a little disheartened.  BBC is a tad too
1432,It was wonderful experience visiting your hotel your staff is amazing the awesome part was red zen I would come to back . Your staff is so helpful they are doing amazing job I still remember few names like Rahul . The Thai food was so delicious üòã
1433,"Excellent value 5 star hotel on the beach. Great rooms, nice pool, fantastic breakfast. Service second to none. Best hotel in the area bar none. Great restaurant across the road - melting pot, very reasonable."
1434,"Hello everyone, i stayed with this hotel back in Jan 2016. At that time i posted pics saying views from Hotel room that different from actual webpage. after my review, Hotel  management smartly put note below every pics that actual views shown on site differs from actual room location. If you surf their website that note has been taken off. If hotel management doesnt take their act together i will post both pics showing how they lie."
1435,Good staff and awesome environment but little to offer on veg menu on a Sunday brunch  Even though whatever offered was splendid with a caring and ready to help staff  Overall nice experience  Definitely revisiting  Thanks
1436,Just one star but then I lets be fair and give them 2 coz of the beach. Managers horrible! they should learn that guests are meant to be treated liked GODS not just the Bollywood celebrities who frequently are seen roaming around the hotel! Will never go back there again!
1437,Stayed at the hotel for 5nights. Everything throughout the 6 days was perfect. Had access to the Executive lounge and the service by Ivan and his team was EXCELLENT.  Breakfast was amazing with the widest range of cuisines I've ever experienced. Also the SPA and gym was amazing. Overall a great stay!!
1438,The Juhu Marriott is an impressive building with a magnificent lobby and sweeping stairway. Our one night stay was very pleasant. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was nice.   The lobby was being renovated however so we didn't get to appreciate it on check in. The temporary check in on the ground floor wasn't well sign posted so we got lost trying to find our way out again!  The only complaint I had was our bed was extremely uncomfortable. There was some kind of additional mattress on top and it was like lying on a sack of potatoes. If we had been staying more than one night I would have asked to switch rooms. I mentioned this to one of the check out staff who said they would check it out.  Great location for the airport and an amazing pool overlooking the beach.
1439,"My second visit here, and just as good as the first.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable, with fast wi-fi and spaces that make it easy to work and also relax. Possibly the best breakfast selection I've ever seen (go for the local options and you won't regret it).   Do bear in mind that you are are good hour from downtown Mumbai, though. Close to the airport, yes; in the centre of things, no..."
1440,"Stayed in Hotel for 6 days. An ultimate hotel to stay in. Executive Lounge is on 4th Floor gives mesmerising view of Juhu Beach and Arabian Sea. The hospitality of Ex Lounge is way beyond expectation. The Lotus Cafe though slightly crowded but with live instrumental music and the service is brilliant. Right from Front Desk, Gym, Health Club, Swimming pool,  Security etc staff is extra courteous and all services are too good. I must stay it's a ""Must Stay Hotel"""
1441,"Haven't stayed at the Marriott at juhu beach for almost three years  Still a pretty good experience  I was a bit thrown when I arrived as I remembered a big lobby but they are installing new doors so they've set up a temporary reception at the side of the hotel - thought for a few moments the driver had brought me to the wrong place!  I had a corner suite which was nice  Service was good as ever  Had a decent meal in the Saffron and an excellent massage also  I would say the exterior of the hotel is looking a bit tired and the windows, given they are floor to ceiling could have done with being cleaner - but then you're right on the coast in a large pollution laden city  My other piece of negative feedback is I popped up to the executive lounge for a pre-dinner drink, it was very"
1442,Worst hosptality.The waiter kept running away before we could even finish our sentences.our rotis never arrived.No veg starters.very spicy biryani.A 3 star hotel provides better experience than this.we had to walk up to the reception and ask for our check. Would never recommend to anyone.
1443,"Stayed for 3 days, is a nice building. easily accessed by tourist. rooms are similar to the contemporary hotels, nothing new feature added to the rooms, Food is great but the chopatti pani puri is a must try if you can survive street food! The real difficulty we faced was parking our car! wish they could tackle the parking issue. other wise good place to stay"
1444,Pros - excellent staff who go out of their way to make your stay memorable - great rooms (standard rooms are very small so I would recommend the club room or the juhu beach suite) - club lounge is great with lots of free snacks. - pool area is the best in Mumbai. Water was a bit cold though - food is very nice - great gym   Cons - breakfast lines in the morning especially after 9 45am.
1445,"Arrival and Reception detail was fabulous and attentive. the person who checked us in did take us up to our room, giving us info about the hotel and its history and showed us in and ran through the room amenities, this was a great personal touch. The room was big and very clean with a very comfortable and soft bed and an array of pillows to choose from.  The Spa was ok and nothing special, it was however dirty and slimy in the jacuzzi an the water level is ket too low so there is loss of power. The attendant tries to make a fuss around you but it then gets too much and in your face. Needs to be more discrete  Poolside was ok but there was drilling one side and with the airport nearby you get the occasional plane taking off but it's the constant fly past of helicopters that is"
1446,"So I was late for my breakfast party and wanted to celebrate with my buddies so where do I go for brunch?? Lotus cafe it is ... Thanks to Jazib Husain and his team I had a great time ...Jazib and his team made sure I had the best Birthday ever awesome food, ambience everything!!!Thankyou Jazib Husain and team.."
1447,"Once again, I was impressed with the utmost care and hospitality that JW Marriott provides to it's guests. Mr. Nambiar, GM leads the staff and all I heard from the staff was about the energy that he infuses. I must mention an experience that left my friend speechless! I was meeting my friend from college after almost 35 years and had left a word with the front door man, Pankaj to let me know when Mr. Kamlesh Mehta arrives in the lobby. When my friend arrived, Pankaj asks my friend if he was Mr. Kamlesh Mehta! My friend was left speechless with the level of service that JWM provides. Everyone takes great pride in working at this place. Here are few individuals that gave me extra-ordinary service - Prashant and Ivan (Lounge), Siddhartha, Akanksha, Pascoal (Front Desk), Raj Kumar"
1448,"I would not know where to start to talk about the fantastic service that we received at this hotel. To make it straightforward and understandable, I sleep at many hotels, this one is number one on my list when it comes to customer service. Nothing went wrong. It was perfect. Additionally, I would like to thank all the employees who made our stay so comfortable, but the outstanding service from Ivan, Alex, Sean, and Swati was impeccable. I am looking forward to seeing you all sooner than later."
1449,"I would especially like to thank Leroy from Lotus Cafe for always serving us with a smile. Thanks to everyone at the Marriott Juhu for make our stay there a memorable one, Because of each and every one of you we will definitely be returning soon. Thank you all!"
1450,"My husband and I stayed in this amazing hotel for 8 nights. Check in was a breeze, we were upgraded to an Executive ocean view room. Everyone at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful. Gaurav Batra, front desk manager was always there with a smile to anwer any of questions and concerns. The room is well appointed with all the necessary aminties. Thank you Sumesh for always keeping our room clean. Everyone at the club lounge is so nice and catered to all of our needs. There's live music every morning and evenings while enjoying our scrumptious breakfast and dinner at the Lotus Cafe. I would like to take my hats off to Chef Nishad Sebastian for a wide selection of delicious food and for also preparing Bindhi masala specially for me. Jazib Husain the restaurant manger for"
1451,"Date of stay: 01st Jan - 02nd Jan 2016 Room: Deluxe Ocean View, Guest room, 1 King Bed  Pros:  - Offered a variety of rooms upon request, after being shown substandard rooms. - Location is very close to Juhu Beach - Shower is produces a truly powerful jet of water. - Spacious luxury bathroom.  Cons:  - Dirty small windows (all the rooms I viewed were like this) that look like they have never been cleaned. Hire a window cleaner!  - Rooms with window ledges on lower floors are a permanent home for groups of noisy pigeons who have decorated it with their droppings. Tried to trick me with this room.  - Surfaces in the rooms had not been dusted upon arrival at all.  - Stench of vomit on the 3rd floor area that had clearly been overlooked.  - Extremely poor customer service. Checked"
1452,Stayed a night in oct for our 20th marr aniv. We have stayed here many times before and it was fantastic as always.  We were upgraded to a higher category room on the forth floor with clear ocean view.the couples spa experience at the hotel was fantastic. The food was excellent especially the indian restaurant when chef qureshi is at work. The pool is large and one can see the ocean from the pool. Also as it is a beach touch property the morning walk on the beach along with people watching can be very interesting.  We would highly recomm this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury stay in that location.
1453,"Very nice, full-service resort right on the Arabian Sea (although understand security considerations that require separation of the resort from the public beach - you can still go out on the beach, but are off resort property; and no concerns with doing so from this reviewer).  Several options for dining, including the great variety of the main buffet style restaurant (which also has menu service).  Great pool facility."
1454,"This hotel has everything, best of rooms, best of food, best of staffs etc. From the time you enter to the lobby to the time you leave, everyone there makes sure you are taken care of. The breakfast is one of its kinds and i will say everyone to try it. Staffs at the check in are great. Special mention to the guest relation manager Ms.Neha, she makes sure to make ur stay outstanding. She was there for anything me and my family required. Solo, Business or family this is a top notch hotel you need to stay at in Mumbai."
1455,The hotel is well located on the beach front and the connected rooms 585&587 have a good ocean view. I The smooth check in by Jidnyasa was fantastic ...thereafter it was downhill in terms of  guest services...there was no one to assist us to our rooms-the key cards were given to us and we saw ourselves to the room. There seems zero co ordination between the reservations and hotel staff as our requirements were not communicated to the hotel -an employee Akshata ( at the AYSdesk) was extremely rude when we asked for a rollaway bed .according to her we made the reservation on the global reservations and it wasn't the fault of the hotel that they couldn't accommodate an extra bed in the room .never in my experience have I been argued with at a five star property -usually they go the
1456,The hotel is located right on the Juhu beach offering some spectacular views of Mumbai's beach line. The Hotel is well spread out giving you a resort feeling right in the middle of the city.  There are a lot of eating options in the Hotel cut across various cuisines. The hotel also has nice fitness facilities and the pool is really nice. The rooms are modern and well equipped.
1457,"This is a great hotel right off a hustling busy road in Juhu, entering the gates feels like stepping into another place when compared to surrounding Mumbai. The room was great and as good as any 5 star hotel I've stayed in. Ate most meals at the buffet, not amazing but just ok. For the 3 days I was there however my room was not made up - I was told this was because the 'Do not disturb' light was on - which a staff member turned on for me when I arrived. The one let down was Refelctions Bar located in the lobby. I was told I was not allowed to stand at the bar and that the bar and surrounding seats were blocked. Where in the world can you not stand at the bar?! A man sat at the end of the bar both nights I was there like he was the king and his lackies drank whisky from the"
1458,"My dinner experience at JW MARRIOTT,JUHU, Saffron Restaurant wasn't good at all... while having dinner there were MOTHS flying around me which was completely a bizarre 5 star experience. Such low food quality standards coming from JW Marriott,Juhu Hotel is something no one expects... thumbs down !!!"
1459,"When it first opened this was the number one Premier destination in Mumbai. I was a regular guest for many nearly 10 years. The restaurants; the ambience of the Club Lounge and Enigma made this an awesome hotel! Those days are well gone and it trades on it's former glory! If you don't upgrade to an executive room; it's a tiny room and no bath; shower only! This once grand hotel has no bar. The beautiful Club Lounge is no more. Reflections is an empty shell with no atmosphere and corporate companies like Apple, simply close restaurants and transform them into bars for their guests as happened tonight.  My advice would be, if you're a solo business traveler, avoid this place. If you're with your family, you'll enjoy the pools and comfort. At ¬£230 a night for an executive room with"
1460,Luxurious hotel. Nice food. You can order ala carte or buffet is also available. With variety of foods available one gets confused what to have and what not to have in buffet. Buffet is reasonable. Will definitely love to visit again.
1461,The rooms are very good with average size. The breakfast was really amazing. Gym was big with all facilities. The best moment was in the pool and also view from the room- Arabian Sea! The staff was good. I need to wait while check out to get my luggage down. Not much parking space available I guess because of Mumbai region. The misic played at central area was nice.
1462,"I am member of the club here, visit this place almost every week. Everything is so fantastic from ambience to rooms to cleanliness here. The Coffee shop BBC is also superb. Pool is also very big and clean."
1463,"We have stayed here twice as a couple and once as a family as overnight between landing in Mumbai and driving to Pune.    As a family of 5 we booked two adjoining rooms, one with a king and one with two twins.  The twins are actually full/double sized so our two smaller kids slept together, and the older one had a bed to himself.  It's clean with a beautiful pool, including a kids pool with slide.  The pool looks out on Juhu beach, as do many rooms.  The buffet meals are excellent with huge choices, both Indian and western food.  As I westerner, my only complaint is when you have Marriott status, they constantly ring your doorbell to bring you small treats (chocolates, cheese snack, cookies).  If you want to rest or be left alone, you have to find the button that tells them not"
1464,"Went for a party once and the place is great. One of the best hotels in  Mumbai and its great,awesome staff and service,interior is fabulous the pub inside is very good.food is also upto its reputation if money is not your concern then its a great place for family gatherings and all."
1465,"For all my business trips, its a great location to be in. Love the clean and tidy rooms, the long queue for breakfast l, talks about the popularity of the buffet. The chefs coming and taking personal care, if there is anything you need outside of the buffet menu, I feel so pampered. Swimming in the pool, watching the sun setting in the ocean, simple access to the beach for a morning walk, sipping coffee in the lounge, or a glass of sparkling during happy hours, or just reading a book...overlooking the sea, watching the birds circle around......its priceless. I never look at company when I am staying there, it gives me enough 'me' time, that we hardly get in our busy lives now a days and so, I always look forward to visiting and staying at the JW Marriott Juhu. Special mention"
1466,"Great service at every stage of the visit. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. The food was excellent and well prepared. Pool, sauna and workout room were also excellent. Access to Juhu beach was convenient  Particular kudos to Hemant, who took care of the room and to Swathi, who captained the lounge. Fresh fruit, plentiful drinks and, believe it or not, excellent coffee! The staff went out of the way to be sure the guest was well taken care of at every turn."
1467,The service especially food is excellent. Though they take time but a good hotel for businesses trip. Also rooms are well maintained plus staff is also good.Their non veg dishes are the ones to go for
1468,Stayed at this property during my business trip recently. The hotel is located near the airport & business districts of Mumbai. Rooms & facilities are decent enough but i dint like the attitude of staff & the executives at the reception.
1469,"This is personal as I never like those hotels that are grand and luxurious, but if you pay attention to the details you know they need upgrade. This one is one of those. You can see the rubber linings along the shower door is old and dirty. The walls need some fresh paint and seriously what is with the abstract photo of a man on the wall staring at me while I shower? The cutlery at the breakfast buffet is not too clean either and the staff didn't understand my request for an omelette."
1470,"This hotel understands service and understands the business traveller.  I've seen others describe it as an oasis and it really is.  Providing a luxury standard in presentation, room amenities (wifi access is free and reliable!) food and service is exceptional (the food is the best I've had in India), and conveniently located close to airport.  What more do you need?"
1471,"In short I enjoyed my stay here. The service is of high standard, the staff are attentive and they provide good service.   Breakfast offers a decent spread to satisfy most tastes. The Exec lounge has nice sunset views and provides decent nibbles.   Only possible downer is the rooms. Even when upgraded (platinum perk) I felt the rooms are a little dated and the mattress felt like an elephant had slept in it. It was so dented and bumpy compared to most JWM beds! Also the phones are so confusing to operate!! Suggest you ask for a room that is sea facing with better views and brighter.    The gym is big, new equipment and nice environment to work out. The pool overlooks the sea and although small is a relaxing tranquil spot.   I arranged a car to collect me from the airport. Easy"
1472,"Good Hotel but needs little bit of maintenance as the building looks old and even the rooms needs renovation, over all good experience, very courteous staff, Lobby looks amazing, Breakfast at Lotus cafe was very nice......need to have more options on IRD menu"
1473,"We stayed at JWM-Juhu for 6 nights in the midst of Ganapati Visarjan. It was crazy outside, however, inside it was an oasis. Took a break from being in a bubble, and walked to Novotel's bar to get a view of the visarjan. Fantastic experience overall."
1474,"We reached there at 8.30a.m in the morning . They were kind enough to give us an early check in . Not only this , they gave us a sea view room on request . The entire check in was very smooth .  The rooms are comfortable and are stocked up with all amenities . The swimming pool is small but good .    The restaurants etc. Are good but I did not get a chance to visit them as my stay was short .  Traffic outside however is a huge nuisance and we the cab that we had booked was stuck up outside for nearly an hour as the police had closed the entry gate to Mariott .   The biggest plus is the hospitality !"
1475,"This property is by far my favourite property... not only cz of the wonderful location and the way it is build but also because it has some amazing warm people working inside!!!  The sales team, events team, banquet team and the front desk team all have been so warm and kind making my event sooo successful...Would really like to thank Priya Singh, nikita , shahnawaz, ashish , junaid and  shaabaaz these guys just never let us down... The food is as alwz amazing and hence its a perfect property to be!!! Looking forward for many more events here üòá"
1476,"We had three stays at this hotel during the month of September 2016.  All three stays were relatively consistent in somewhat changed culture towards customer service when compared to the previous stays just few months ago.  The best service still persists in the Executive Lounge where staffs like Ivan with bright smiles and eagerness to help completely overshadows some of the service flaws in the front lobby and in the restaurant.  Equally pleasant to us were the bright and young staff members working with Ivan that included Senthil, Rohit, Prashant, and Mohit.  Very specifically, Mr. Prashant Chauhan remains embedded in our memories because of his exceptional talents for customer relations, for his ability to please any guest, his eagerness to serve, his motivation to excel,"
1477,"Very ho-hum experience. Disappointed by almost everything including service (wine promised to us never arrived; had to call multiple times; staff was, in general, not as pleasant as you'd expect; I was told gruffly by a staff member that ""you cannot stay after 2 pm ok?"" when I requested a late check-out), room view (I was told it was a sea-view room, but basically it was 60-70% of the hotel facade with a distant view of the beach) and food (the buffet is massive, but the food doesn't taste so good; the staff told me off at breakfast saying the dosa counter is closed even though I requested nicely, and they were still clearing pending orders), apart from the room itself -- though I would have dearly loved a bathtub. The only reason I'd stay here over my favourite -- Trident"
1478,We had an expensive brunch on 02 Oct 2016. It's the poorest buffet spread I have seen in years. Almost no Indian selection except for a few apologetic dal and kadhi containers accompanied by a suggestion ask for naan - roti. No Indian dishes in starters. Nothing Indian in desserts. Live counters mostly non-vegetarian. Poor service accompanies the poor spread. The waiters are very busy doing nothing. The fellow serving drinks looked clearly harassed. An excellent example of a worst buffet.
1479,"Everything at this hotel speaks of luxury, from the limousine collection at the airport to the wonderful breakfast selection. The thoughtful care offered by cheerful, pleasant staff and the standard of room fittings added to the pleasure of staying here. Staying on the 4th floor with the additional benefit of the Executive Lounge added to the feeling of being special and the leisure facilities are good with the occasional celebrity sighting. Highly recommended!"
1480,"JW Marriott , Juhu Tara Road - I was their guest for 4 days and enjoyed the location, facilities, comfort, sea view, room service, house keeping. My children loved the room and would enjoy their bath, stay, food and the fun. Overall a great experience."
1481,"Located close to International Airport , mumbai.  We had a suite and though it was adequate , I must mention that the washroom which is accessed from the bedroom via a sliding door is odd as the door slides on to the bathtub and you have to open the door fully to enter. So you end up throwing light on your partner who is sleeping!  Secondly , the toiletries are average and the body lotion feels soapy. The good part is the efficient staff and the spread in the coffee shop both for dinner and breakfast is excellent"
1482,This is a 5 Star Hotel which definitely lives up to the Marriott Brand. Located at a fantastic place just overlooking the Arabian Sea. Rooms are luxurious. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Pool is situated at a fantastic place and its very clean.
1483,"I had the pleasure of staying at this fabulous property for about 3 weeks this month.  Being away from home (on business) can be rough, but the staff at Juhu were absolutely amazing!  Let me start with the trainers in the gym, Rakesh and Shekhar.  These guys were always there to lend a helping hand and give you tips/feedback if needed.  As for the lounge area, Ivan and Puht (sic), were equally impressive, as they always remembered my name and were there to help me relax in that lounge after a long day at the office.  The staff member who made the most lasting impression, however, was Choki.  She seemed to work both at the front desk, as well as in the lounge area.  She would consistently check with me to see how my stay was, asking if there was anything she (or the staff) could"
1484,"From the reception to the general hospitality, amazing place! I'm from SA and to eat India cuisine like this was an amazing first time experience for me personally. Fancy hotel and dining area.. recommended to all..."
1485,"Was there for 2 night for business event two times, awesome hotels and rooms. Excellent food, best sea view. I can say this is the best hotel in Mumbai. You will often see lot of Bollywood celebrities moving around in and out hotel. Near Bachchan home and centrally located in Juhu. Most importantly Juhu beach."
1486,Staff was very helpful with every aspect of the stay. Very clean. State of the art work out facility. Good view of the beach. Everyone was so polite.   I'd recommend this as the place to stay and I wont stay anywhere else in Juhu
1487,Sunday Brunch at Lotus cafe is a culinary artefact. Complete Value for money and a sole rejuvenating experience. The Brunch is good for family or even for business meet up. Kid's area adds value to us
1488,"Stayed recently and was very disappointed. The check in person was unfriendly. The dining room staff were extremely unhelpful and at times came across rude. The employees at this hotel looked very unhappy and uncaring. The rooms were tired looking and average, the ocean front suite had an amazing view but tired looking. I expected the service to be at a higher level for such a supposedly luxury location."
1489,"Lovely ambience n amazingly delicious buffet spread suitable for kids n adults. Great ambience n decor makes the evening special.  Enjoyed evening with family...  Mom enjoyed the Indian cuisine, starters n non veg biryani n more...  My son 7yrs enjoyed the chat, freshly baked pizzas, and the amazing desert spread :)"
1490,I've been to J W Marriott Sahar specially for famous pizza üçï which were described in Bombay Times üì∞ newspaper.   The quality of food(üçï) was much more than what I was expecting. I've ordered Rustica pizza which was thin crust large sized made by original Multigrain base topped with real Mozerella cheese üßÄ and was prepared by Italian master chef.   I was really amazed to the hospitality delivered & thoroughly guided by Cheif Concierge Mr Vinayak Khule many many thanks to him.   My overall evening was awesome.
1491,"I had travelled with my parents in Feb for a couple of weeks which turned into a nightmare as dad fell ill. My mother hates big hotels, she always feels intimidated by them. I managed to persuade her to spend our last couple of days at J W Marriott. On the morning we left, she said she had completely fallen in love with the hotel. The attentive staff and service helped her overcome any feelings of intimidation she had about grand hotels."
1492,"The hotel has a beautiful, artsy, plush ambience. The staff is helpful but not in your face like I've seen at other hotels before. The facilities and amenities are at par.  There are some aspects that were disappointing.  The dining experience at lotus cafe was poor. The taste of the food could be improved.   The concierge was by far the most disappointing. I had discomfort in the ear and I asked for the nearest medical shop so I could go and get ear drops.. The concierge insisted on arranging it for me and told me I would get it delivered to my room. Nothing got delivered!! This is a serious lapse for a hotel that boasts of perfect service.  Overall, I enjoyed the property. I wouldn't mind staying here again..."
1493,Hotel location is good. on juhu tara road and arabian sea at the back side. hotel has large lobby and dinning area. Food quality is NOT great and tastes average. staff is ok. rooms are very small and diagonal on one side to provide arabian sea view but it made  the rooms very congested and clogged. bathroom doors suits honeymoon couples.
1494,Visited hotel last week for a leisure trip...clean rooms ...beautiful pool and you can go to the beach too from the hotel itself ...had great time in spa enjoyed the jacuzzi steam and sauna ...breakfast was well organised..overall great time...esp mention to Siddharth from front desk
1495,"Staying at the JW Juhu is quite a treat. Lovely property, very good location.  You're bound to do some celebrity spotting if you're here!   The breakfast is  a real spread and you are spoilt for choice.   Had some issues with room service and they were quick to react and rectify. In fact, I wasn't even charged for the meal. Always nice when hotels accept that errors happen."
1496,Excellent property and gives a feel of being in a resort as its right at the beach and also has an excellent pool; still being in right in the heart of the city which makes it so great.  The hotel is well maintained with one the best lobbies ever with live music being played at most times of the day which is so relaxing and also lively.  The staff is good and food quality remains excellent.
1497,"We had a very memorable evening at the Saffron. The food was extraordinary but the main thing was the waiters Shefali, Sohan the chef. We have seldom been treated with such an openness, helpfulness and friendliness. At the end the chef even gave us the recipe for the most delicious Subz Peshawari. Thank you all for that great evening. Best"
1498,"The best part about this hotel is its location, right on front of the beach. Its got a beachfront pool and I had a nice view of the beach from my room. However, considering that its marquee under the JW brand, I did expect more. The JW @ Sahar airport and the Renaissance @ Powai are much better options in comparison to this. The rooms are small for a JW, specially since they claimed that they upgraded me given my Gold status (So wondering what the regular room would be like). Food spread is great though I felt the staff were pretty confused. The check-in was hassle free but slow, check-out was much better. While the breakfast buffet spread was great, there was no one to seat you around plus the layout is slightly confusing. In all marred by a number of small niggles and can do"
1499,"The food provided was top quality Welcoming breakfast staff was supporting to accept our Order too  Out of way staff was giving us support  Location is excellent  Great services and warm welcoming was providing from the1st meeting point  Thanks to receptionist with warm welcoming  Thanks to bellboys   Thanks to outside securities  Thanks to house keeping  Thanks to make our journey so memorable that we are plans our next trip to India Mumbai  I can no other answer comments to say or to write , but, thanks, and thanks for making our week so shining and"
1500,This is one of the best hotel i have visited soo far. Its interior is really superb and i go there very frequently. The best i think is the lotus cafe which is huge and has ample of space to sit and chill.
1501,"Recently used this hotel for a week long workshop that required 24hr support and the hotel staff provided this and more. The food provided was top quality and varied throughout the week, plenty of staff around to provide beverages and the WiFi was fast and reliable. Little bit of a track to centre of Mumbai (1.5hr) but this was acceptable for my purpose. Very safe location."
1502,"It has always been a good experience at jw marriott but on my recent stay there the service ,far exceeded my expectations and all thanks to Ms Deepika kukreja for putting in so much efforts into service and details ."
1503,Jw Marriott hotel mumbai very nice...i like here.good place... I want go back here again my good memory.first time in mumbai in my life.meeting someone and meeting some life style Indian people. I like mumbai
1504,"My always first delight to stay at JW Marriot,the problems are very delayed room service,lot of mosquitoes in restaurants esp.Mezzo and no one to take care or be bothered.The spa is wonderful with excellent service,the pool is good but no cleaning of water and after rains no bother and this no bother costed me to slip and by God no one was there to look,and more disgusting on calling for a muscle spray the room service was of no bother and even on approaching the front desk manager it did not bend his ears.My stay of the three days was ruined for the pain I suffered and I vacated the hotel without even having the luxury to adorn the benefits of meals and in room services of foods etc.due to the negligence causing me a severe muscle burst in my right leg. the only consolation was"
1505,Have been a regular for last two years. There have been one or two incidents earlier but this time it was something serious which is making me share it here.   Stayed for a day and checked out on 13th. Toilet had hairs on the wall. Pathetic housekeeping. Shared pictures with front office. Dont know what happened thereafter.
1506,Maaan! My recent stay in this hotel was just memorable ... What a sevice and .. Even the staff was amazing ... Has stayed in this hotel for about 4 days ... But it was an awesome stay amazing food .. In Fact most of the people have become familiar with me now ... Go ahead for it
1507,"I am a big fan of the JW Marriot chain of hotels. The one in Dubai at Business Bay is my favourite..it's like a second home for me..and so now whenever I travel to Mumbai, there is only one place to stay - JW Marriott at Juhu. I have always liked this property - the ambience, the variety in cuisines, the service, the location and the excellence with which the staff always manages to deliver. The Desk office manager at the property - Gaurav Bhatra was extremely helpful, professional and ensured that my stay there was a typical JW style.. In short, efforts were made by him and his team to ensure that the stay was comfortable, and all the requirements were delivered as requested - whether it was room requirements or food customised to my liking. I would highly recommend anyone"
1508,The lobby is impressive as is the pool.  However the exterior of the building is not well maintained. And you think to yourself beach right - wrong. The beach is dingy and access to it is controlled which is ok bc you don't want people coming on the property so it goes to figure you don't want to go out. The pool area is impressive and those grounds are well maintained. We even saw them spraying for mosquitos.  Wifi is readily available in the hotel but if you merely dine there you don't get free access to the wifi.
1509,We stayed in a room with club lounge access .all amenities and large size of room made our stay pleasant .Breakfast at club lounge had limited variety of hot breakfast.Hotel has the best location of Juhu and it was the best blend of hospitality and luxury.we would love to come and stay again .
1510,Really good service from the front office. Staff makes you feel important. Fair pricing for the quality of service and beautiful location. wifi was fast. Would recommend for business trips and who needs to be close to the airport.
1511,"Among all the 5-7 stars that we have been to, Marriott Juhu has been our worst experience. I am surprised to experience the blunders made by the hotel. Let me put it in points.  1. I booked the hotel through phone and after the confirmation of the booking I didn't get any confirmation mail.  2. Few days before my visit I called the customer care and have to remind them for the mail and they sent it.  3. The mail did not say anything about the details of my booking. Only arrival and departure dates and number of guests. That's it.  4. On the day of arrival I tried calling the hotel people to confirm about my pick and drop details. I kept calling but I couldn't get to speak any of them as every time it says ""All our executives are busy attending calls. Pls call later."" 5. Pick and"
1512,I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. Truly amazing experience. The view of the Arabian Sea from the room was one of its kind. Food is just too good. Overall an experience to remain with me for a long time.
1513,"It's a beautiful hotel. Specially the lobby.  I loved everything about this hotel but the rooms are bit cramped up as per JW standards.  Mumbai is a big city with space constraints as many other big towns. But still, for staying, there are better hotels.  If you are going for an overall excellence of hotel services, it is one of the best."
1514,We celebrated a friends birthday in the room and the hotel especially the duty manager Ms Deepika Kukreja helped in organising all what was asked for and more.  The hotel is amazing with the best sea view in Mumbai  She helped in arranging the meal and late check out with dinner reservations too and it was a memorable evening
1515,Just wanted to highlight what an excellent service I received recently from Vijay Thakur who works at the hotel's concierge.Recently a friend of mine visited India for the first time and was a little worried about the stay and hospitality at JW Marriott Juhu Mumbai but I am really happy to share my experience about the hospitality we received from Vijay who went for the extra mile on many occasions and fulfilled all my requests in no time. Vijay ensured that my friend's stay at the hotel is more than pleasant and also delivered whenever there was a personal request which made the entire experience very comfortable. Me and my friend have been to many other hotels in different parts of the world but have never received service like this before.   JW Marriott should be really proud
1516,"I love this hotel very much. Everything is just right, the reception is spacious and elegant, staff were very professional, rooms were of reasonable size, breakfast variety and hall were enormous. Executive lounge was lovely and food was great. I will always book myself in this hotel whenever I go to Mumbai. Just because it is perfect."
1517,"The JW Marriott is a beautiful hotel that consistently delivers wonderful service and amenities. I have stayed here multiple times over the last few years and it is one of the best hotels in Mumbai. The hotel offers the Omega bakery and a small shop inside. Mornings are a wonderful breakfast buffet. The hotel offers private cars/drivers for hire to go sightseeing, shopping, or the office if necessary."
1518,"JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu is a far most hotel experience you don't want to miss. Year after year, since 2006, month after month I have an opportunity to come and stay at this beautiful property and found my self surrounding with hospitality indian culture and people famous for. Besides that JW Marriott brand strives and stays with its promise to deliver an excellent service and opportunity to relax and rejuvenate;  I want to give a credit to stuff and management of this hotel, to all chefs and waiters at Lotus cafe and every one else, who work tirelesly to make your experience unforgettable and remarkable and wanted to come again and again and again. Thank you from a bottom of my heart! Namaste!"
1519,"This hotel is in a nice location and the facilities are comfortable. My housekeeper was great.  The room was kept spotless and he even left me with some surprises like an elephant made of towels.  I used the fitness center and pool, both of which were well maintained and spacious.  I loved the view at breakfast where I could watch birds on the pond.  The business center was fine.  I had a little issue with printing, but the attendant quickly fixed it.  I do have a few complaints.  The staff at the breakfast took about 25 minutes to get me a waffle one morning.  I had to ask 3 different people before they brought it and when it came, it was one tiny square with the syrup already on it, not what I was expecting.  In the evening, when dining at the same restaurant, I ordered a"
1520,"Stayed here for a night along with my Mom for a birthday/ girls night out. Enjoyed the breakfast and dinner at Lotus cafe and were truly pampered at the Spa. The staff are very courteous always and very efficient .Specil mention and thanks to Brendan for a quick Checkin and follow up during the stay and to the ladies at Quan spa - Karuna, Kenny and Theama. Even though such service is expected from most 5 star properties having stayed in most hotels worldwide sometimes lack of hospitable staff disappoints . This was not the case here. Thank you for a lovely experience overall.."

This was not the case here .Thank you for a lovely experience overall.."
1522,"Since it opened, I have stayed at this JW 3 to 4 times every year. By now many staff recognize me and make me feel so at home with  their wonderful hospitality, especially at Exec Lounge. Thank Sonia, Anish and others!"
1523,"It's one of the best hotels in the city and my favourite. Being Preffered members at this hotel has benefited us while dining. We also stayed in the hotel and it has been a Geeta experience. I love the food at lotus cafe and saffron. The staff is polite and courteous, managers too constantly ensure that guest are being taken care of well."
1524,"A very warm welcome, efficient check in, spacious room and marble bathroom to die for and of course the view of Indian Ocean. You are nearly tempted to stay in all day long. Wonderful oasis of calm and elegance in the midst of Mumbai's hustle and bustle."
1525,"We recently became members of the Marriot. Stayed at the hotel on the 29/30th of August using the one night free stay to celebrate my husband's 35th birthday. From the start it was an excellent stay. We were in the Juhu beach suite. We did a quick check-in and the welcome drink was excellent. The suite on the second floor was small compared to other suites we have stayed in but the view was excellent. A living room, a bed room and two bathrooms. Very comfortable. The in-room dining options seemed very limited so we did both our meals the lunch and dinner at the Lotus cafe. Breakfast the next morning was great as well. The staff was very courteous. Sunny was at our service each time we wanted anything. Jazib Hussain was great help too during our lunch at the cafe.  We have been"
1526,Enjoyed the place . gym was awesome and other amenities. Highly recommend every 1 for stay there. Close to beach and shopping centre. Great dinning places in the hotel. Rooms are cleans and tidy as well. 15 mins from the airport. You will also bump into celebrities as well.
1527,"Booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. I got picked up by a hotel driver at the airport (which you need to book in advance of course). The hotel is located about 30 minutes by car from the international Airport, which was one of the reasons for me to stay there. Also, it's right on Juhu beach with secured and private access to and from the beach. Hotel security is comforting and all cars as well as individuals are screened before receiving access to the hotel.  My room was clean and spacious, bathroom amenities were nice. Only remark: I was on the patio side of the hotel and I believe the hotel has a major 'pigeon' challenge. My room was overlooking the restaurant roof and there are tons of pigeons there... making a big mess as a result. I"
1528,JW Marriot Juhu is a beautiful property with fantastic services and amenities. The food was very tasty. I also saw the full hotel after that. Poolside area was the best. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with lovely king size bed.
1529,Reception was very crowded on arrival as there was a wedding show on the lower floors. However check in was faultless and we were impressed by the friendliness of all staff. Rooms are extremely modern and very well equipped. Hotel is on beach and swimming pool area is superb. We upgraded to the executive room which was only ¬£10 more than just paying for the executive lounge access (¬£40 per night for free food throughout day and free alcohol between 5.30 and 9.30 - India is surprisingly expensive for booze) and included free wifi (otherwise you need to pay c¬£8 per day for it unless you are a Marriotts reward member - but it's the fastest internet I've experienced in India at 17mbps) what really impressed me was the excellent service we received in the exec lounge all staff were
1530,"Our visit to this highly recommended hotel was quite disappointing, We were booked at the club room with the room quite poorly done up; the staff were quite unfriendly. After repeated calls and after an hour any request was complied to. Lot of maintenance issues; The TV, the tea kettle was not functioning, no top ups and refills done. The room was never serviced well. The breakfast was very average. Same dishes daily and the south indian items like sambar can be better prepared rather than making it a sweet dish,Could hardly see a smile or greeting of the staff any where. The only saving grace was Mr Gaurav who apologized for the lapses and offered us a complementary dinner just the day before our departure, Appreciate his gesture. But surely would not want to stay at this"
1531,"This is a decent hotel. However, it's not an excellent hotel. Considering the fact that it is a Marriot hotel, where one pays top dollar, I noticed a few things that need to get better.   The staff is courteous, helpful, worthy of the brand.  The pool of the hotel is very good, gives a very nice feel.  However, the ponds just before that needs to be maintained better. Saw algae all around. The outer facade of the hotel when looking from the beach side does not give the look of a Marriot property, being on the beach has its effect on the colour.  The Spa is very good.  The Lotus Cafe is okay.  Mezzo Mezzo is very good.  The hotel would do well with a Night club which has been shut for long now"
1532,"Traveling all over the world, having stayed in best hotels like Ritz Carlton Chicago, Ritz Carlton Napels,Raffles Singapore, Four seasons Bangkok, JW Marriott Marquise Dubai and eating in many places - right from fine dining to popular street-food in different cities ‚Äì one place that always amaze me is Lotus Cafe at JW Marriott,Juhu Mumbai.  This is one of the most happening place among the restaurants which I have visited in last few years. It is surprising  to see the crowd at this cafe. Location, view, food and buffet spread and the best, its smooth operation, you will never see in any other hotels in the country. One need to visit this place to experience how beautifully and efficiently, they are maintaining  best taste all through their different and exciting themes."
1533,Backing Co. : very good food and excellent service. Good place to visit with family and friends. it stands out to be on 100/100. I recommended this place to my friends and family to visit for good desert ( cakes and muffins are excellent).
1534,"Tried the veg and the non veg set menu at Saffron, was very delicious; accompanied with live music, made for a great dining experience. Very friendly and courteous service. Definitely worth many more visits."
1535,Staying in JW marriott was a very soothing experience. It has a very nice ambience. The interior is very good. The staff also is very helpful and polite. They offer very nice deals during off season. It has a beach view with a swimming pool! The coffee shop and the bakery here offers a amazing beverages.
1536,"The start was not good at this hotel.  There was a problem with our booking which had been done months in advance. We had booked 2 executive ocean view rooms. We were told that only the deluxe room had been booked. We showed the person at the check in counter our booking confirmation from our travel agents. He still was not willing to accept that. We then had to ring our travel agency and tell them to sort this out, The guy at the check in counter was not helpful at all. After all that we finally got the rooms that we paid for. Not as grand as lead to believe on websites. They were on the small side. As we had booked executive rooms we were entitled to the facilities in the executive lounge. We went there and were told that we weren't entitled to it. So we had to go back the"
1537,"We have stayed at the JW a few times before, and have never been disappointed. This time however, exceeded all our expectations and we had the most wonderful 13 day stay. One of the key differences for me this time was the very good team work that was evident across departments, there was very little of the usual hierarchy that I often see in hotels in India. Our stay was unusually long for this hotel, but that gave a chance to see the hotel operation in full swing, and I must say that the level of performance was consistent throughout.  Security in the public areas and at access points was top notch the doormen were pleasant and helpful, as were the guys at the bell desk and concierge.  One disappointment was around the policy of issuing an interim bill when the spend goes"
1538,"The hotel is very well located in Juhu, the rooms are upholstered well though the food spread isn't that great to taste (that used to be their USA); well don't worry much about it cause you can walk up to many eateries around!! The stay would be nice in their hospitality.."
1539,Overall a beautiful hotel. Yummy brunch at the Cafe with a stunning view of the pool and the ocean. Italian restaurant is very good and so is the indian restaurant at the hotel. Always bought breads from their bakery on a regular basis.
1540,"My husband and I checked in for a staycation to celebrate my birthday over the weekend. After upgrading to the premiere level suite at a minimal fee, our staycation was made special by the team at the executive lounge on the fourth floor. Samantha Pereira and team showered us with their warm and friendly hospitality, catering to our every need with big helpful smiles. They ensured great company, great food and great ambience. The birthday cakes sent to my room and cut at the lounge with flowers showed a special personal touch. The card made it even more special.  The Mariott experience was a wonderful one. A well attended large pool, luxurious spa, and great speciality restaurants with helpful staff made our weekend extra memorable. Waiting to come back soon for sure!"
1541,"Stayed at JWM, Juhu for 5 nights. The overall experience was good. Quick Review Hotel Location and approachability is good - close to the beach and decent drive from the airport Check-in was fast and easy Room Size and Furnishing - Very good. Food and Beverages - Yummy. Probably the second reason I would go back to JWM. (1st one I shall state later) The best thing - Highly courteous, friendly and understanding staff. (1st reason to get back)  Things to improve - The child high chair needs to have a safety belt. Hope they have implemented this. No excuses.  Recommendations: Lobby Managers : Gaurav and Deepika  - Highly professional!! Keep it up guys."
1542,Last week i visited with couple of my friends for dinner... had an great evening... Special care taken by Mr. Vijay.. We all loved the Food and Ambience... We will be soon back.. Thanks to Hospitality.
1543,Visited Saffron at JW Mariotte Juhu on 21st August for a birthday dinner. The food was delicious and served hot. After a long time we had sumptuous meal and the ambience of this place is excellent along with service very good service.Mr Rameez who was attending to us was very courteous and caring he took care of all minute details that indicates his dedication and commitment towards work. Nevertheless to say the manager Aniket Shelar and his colleague were very nice and made our evening a memorable one. Aniket made good arrangements for the birthday celebrations. We would like to thank the staff of Saffron for hospitality rendered and wish them All the best.  Shall surely visit again.  Regards  Rahul Dutia
1544,I went with my husband in may for short trip. once we were inside hotel we didn't feel like we are in bombay. Hotel have excellent food and good service. Spa is good. only thing i found overly priced is their treatments. same treatments you can find half price of marriots local beauty and spa place. Overall good experience. will stay again in marriots.
1545,"i was with my fiancee at Bombay Baking Co cake shop at JW, wanted to buy a chocolate pastry to convince her as she was angry the staff at the property was so judgemental that they turned us up with surprises and me n my fiancee was amazed by this the pastry was mouthwatering so i ordered a cake of 1 kilo for my fiancee. the manager vijay his staff gladwin, akshay pavithra all were superb a true hospitality icons as we indians are known for it hats off to all at Bombay Baking Company. and thank you so much for making our trip wonderful will do visit again."
1546,"I stayed her many nights some years ago and found this to be one of the best hotels I stayed in during many international travels in many different countries. The room it selves is small, however very functional with all equipment and comfort you need. Whats really make this hotel GREAT is the building, interior, outside area and beach side. The restaurant area in the lower level serve a variety of superb food, by a staff that are extremely service focused. In this hotel there are also a couple of niche restaurants that I rate on very high level. The pool area and surroundings is amazing, you could swim and view the ocean one level down. Sunset is wonderful from here. Today this is still and upper end hotel with excellent qualities and charm. However the price level is not as"
1547,Had an amazing time staying at jw .. Very friendly staff. Specially Siddharth Chitnis & Harendra from front office was very polite and quick at the check in procedures. They also took care of my pleasant stay and were very helpful. Must visit for a relaxing and pleasant holiday.
1548,"In fact, this was a very nice hotel. I found it clean and tidy. The service there was great. The staff were helpful. The food there was delicious. I strongly recommend it for you specially if you are intending to stay in juhu. For me i dont think i will go again and stay in juhu."
1549,"If you're fond of the sea, and love luxury, then this is the place to stay in Mumbai. You get treated like a VIP, and these guys know how to pamper you to death. Stayed at the Executive Floor, where the suites are sumptuous, and the private dining area is exclusive!!! The swimming pool is simply awesome, and so is the beach, which is right outside the hotel!! What more can one ask for!!!"
1550,"This hotel is like an oasis in a desert  Staff fabulous, ambience of the lobby and the restaurant (Lotus Cafe)  I accidentally left my rolex watch in the room (which is unlike me) but it happened. The housekeeper obviously noticed it and kept it aside, which was quite astounding given that I would expected it to have been stolen so that was impressive and quite a relief!  Location is also excellent  I would highly recommend this hotel"
1551,I have had amazing stay in JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar and i expected similar experience in JW Marriott Juhu. Reception staff were not so helpful and i would call them borderline rude. The room was small and cramped. The view from breakfast lounge was awesome though! Breakfast was good too. Silver lining- U can run into celebrities here often. We had the oppurtunity of meeting Nana Patekar Ji. :)
1552,"My friends and me along with our families had visited the Lotus Cafe at the JW Marriott for their Sunday brunch and I was totally blown away with their wide and extravagant Brunch buffet. The spread had a variety of Indian dishes along with great Pastas, Pizzas, chaats, variety of different meats and an amazing dim sum selection etc. It's a great place for families with kids too cause they have a dedicated play area for kids with lots of fun activities. So this way the kids will be entertained and parents can relax too.I have eaten at various restaurants in Mumbai but never have I come across such a wide and tasty spread. The service at Lotus Cafe by their Manager Mr Jazib Hussain and his team was nothing short of exceptional. A must visit"
1553,Stayed for a night & the experience was amazing! The entire staff were exceptionally good! The breakfast spread was awesome.. The in room dining menu is pretty okay.. The cake was yum!!! Overall a very good experience..
1554,Stayed at JW Marriott Juhu 3-4 during the last six months.  Great experience ....from check in to room service to housekeeping to gym and spa.  Staff is extremely professional and courteous and takes pains to delight the customer. Team JW - special shout out for Siddharth Chitnis @ Front Desk for this great experience..- special shout out for the the staff at the lounge .....folks keep up the good work. You raise the bar for others.
1555,"J W Marriott Hotel at Juhu adjoining the sands of famous Juhu beach is a romantic place to stay, enjoy and relax and get your batteries recharged. We have been periodically enjoying our stay here whenever an opportunity in the form of extended weekend arrives. We checked in a decent and functional room,though a bit smallish. The features which attracted our attention were: good quality shower fittings with a sitting bench in shower area, a console enclosing tea\coffee making area in place of open area on table top, and last but not the least, excellent sea view and poolside view from the window and its clear and a bit enlarged reflection on the large mirror across the working desk. We were very satisfied with the facilities provided at the spa and the gym, the service was"
1556,Well I have been to many hotels but not seen such a  wide spread buffet and the seating. Was an excellent experience one of the managers Mr. Jazib I hope I have spelt it right was very helpful and since it was 15th August and a dry day and my friend was staying in the near by hotel hence I insisted to have a couple of drinks at the J W. Jazib offered the Thai menu as well as the liquid menu and was kind enough to show us around. And the staff was also very prompt at the service.   Loved the place cheers would love to come back.   Thank you
1557,Stayed for a night and the experience was exceptionally good. From entrance to check-out had an amazingly smooth stay. Staff members are very attentive and view is mesmerising. Pool and health club is just so perfect for a business traveller. Thank you will visit again soon.
1558,"Mr vijay from Bombay baking he is fantastic,v polite ,he is an asset to Marriot group, excellent service, very genuine  person to much dedicated to his work. Me and my family love to come back. strongly recommend please visit Bombay baking at Marriott"
1559,"Grouped in for a dinner after a long day at work with office colleagues. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed both the food and the ambience. What was outstanding was the service which was excellent. We were treated as vip guests. As I travel extensively, I usually dine at different hotels but the service here was par excellance."
1560,"I must say this hotel is something you would love to stay at. The property is well situated. The hotel management is very friendly, when I reached there my room was upgraded to executive room without any extra charge. It was such a delight and the view from the room was just amazing. With rain coming down and the sea view from your window. It makes your day. And the room service part was also excellent. you don't really have to worry about anything. Hotel has many place to eat and drink which are also amazing. I would suggest this to go for rather than going for any other option."
1561,"we booked into this hotel for a few days .  Must say its one of the best hotels we have stayed in . The best part of the hotel is the  LOTUS CAFE, we had our breakfast & evening meals here .  The breakfast spread is just enormous.  our thank you to parag & saurabh who served us most of the time, they knew exactly what we wanted & when we wanted . special thanks you to Vivak & Nishant ( the managers ) a credit to the company, how they managed everything , how they  interacted with the guests was joy !! . we also enjoyed the service we received at the mealtime in the evening , where the service of Sager & Vinesh was excellent.  Again pleased with the two managers Jazib  & Soham , who made our time very pleasant .  Very much looking forward to our return  to this great hotel soon ."
1562,This is a excellent property. The staff is very helpful and courteous. The housekeeping is excellent and a special mention about Ranveer who is very good at his job. Would love to go back someday and spend some more time at this property. I highly recommend this property to families who are visiting Mumbai.
1563,Loved this property. Right on the juhu beach. Very much heart of Mumbai.   I wonder some time. How do they train their staff to respond with so much of warmth because some time guess also act weird.   One of the best breakfast setup. Room service go out of way to make dish which is not on standard menu. Nicely maintained rooms. Prompt house keeping. Did not try spa as it too expensive  Would love to come back
1564,"It's an impressive hotel and I felt very well looked after during both my stays earlier in the year. The lobby is stunning, the staff are very helpful, and I particularly enjoyed the fact that you can get some fresh air in the pool area overlooking the beach. There's a (heavily secured) path to the beach directly from the outside area so you can enjoy the sunset by the ocean, which was just stunning. The food was superb!"
1565,"Been to this hotel on 20th June and 1st of July for a business meeting, very good hotel and good service, food is also good , wifi is available but it is chargable, a hotel like this should give free wifi"
1566,Excellent hotel that I have stayed at frequently. The facility is great and they have a great staff. Special recognition to greater Gurmeet Sinuh (Spelling?) who is always there for whatever you need.
1567,Hotel still maintains its charm and a class apart service standards. Staff is outstanding and rooms give you one of the best view of the ocean. Hotel has amazing food offerings and they have a new restaurant dashanzi which is quite a treat! Definitely a must try when in the city!
1568,JW Marriott hotel is a good hotel in Mumbai. I visited the hotel many times with family and friends.  You can visit these place with family and friends at well..  The food is also good in taste.  The rooms for stay are good.
1569,"Situated about an hour from South Mumbai where most of the places of interest are!  The beach is not a typical rest and enjoy beach...too much pollution to swim, and feel comfortable.  Hotel pool is good but can be overcrowded.  The restaurant is mega and more large scale cafeteria. Good service but of an industrial scale..."
1570,"My stay at the Marriott Juhu was absolutely amazing.  The service was impeccable and the accommodations were elegant.  Dinner at the Saffron restaurant was definitely an experience I will remember fondly.  My server, Herbert, went about and beyond and even provided me a guided tour of the restaurant which was a real treat.  Thank you to the staff for a very relaxing and enjoyable visit."
1571,I was in JW Marriott last week. Enjoyed the Monsoon rains from the window of a lovely room. Enjoyed the Breakfast every morning with Tabla and Jal Tarang Thank you Siddharth at the Front office.  Thank you team in the coffee shop. Siddharth looking forward to more visits. 1 feedback. Room service needs to improve.
1572,"I book my hotel on my wedding night. experience to stay in this hotel make you world class person. arrangement and view was awesome, the privacy for a day make a perfect moment. Arrangement from the check in to check out was awesome, Breakfast is too good, staff is really cooperative and responsive with in a time, i would definitely go and stay there for more than one day, because the comfort and experience i get that make me realise that its worth for 5 star. Famous name also provide that type of treatment to the customer, its make your moment enjoyable and happy more than i think."
1573,J w is a class apart hotel to stay to visit n to chill out v near to the airport  with all world best amenities food over there is excellent n all restaurants to also location is best staff over there is v well mannered n courteous once in life expiernevce to stay over there
1574,"I visited hotel with my husband as we were on leisure, right from the check in till the time checked out of the hotel everythng was jus awesome and cant complaint about anythng. Duty manager Siddharth Chitnis we met him the lobby and he was very pleasant and helpful with always a smile on his face really took good care of us."
1575,"This should be your address if you're planning to stay in the Mumbai Suburbs. You have access to all the amenities that you consider the norm elsewhere in the world, but with a beautiful Indian touch."
1576,"An Indian saying tells you a man's heart can be won through his stomach  but I tampered it by replacing man with all. All hearts can be won through good food. 31st July 2016 was the most important day of our lives to witness our son turning 18 and we chose  J W MARRIOTT MUMBAI to celebrate  .when my son enjoyed with his friends at Lotus cafe we chose saffron and I really loved my decision. We had dry martinis, virgin mojito, chicken biryani , butter chicken and garlic naans and many more delicacies like shahi tukda, Gulab jamun,Ras malai and Paans at the end.They offer different kind of kebabs chicken mutton lamb and a huge list of  vegetarian and non vegetarian  delicacies may be it starters or the main course, a fair list of desserts , breads and drinks you may choose"
1577,"Great hotel, great breakfast , nice food and beverage  options and , worth staying. Tried Sunday brunch at the coffeeshop, it's probably the best in the city and always full I would come back for sure for leisure  Associate are very professional  and always willing to help"
1578,"The resort is build for leisure, business, get to gether.. you name it. The ambience is gorgeous. The food is lovely and the hospitality is impeccable. Love their breakfast spread. A must stay if the place fits ur budget."
1579,Stayed in the lotus suite at Marriott for 2 nights...totally amazing property...rooms are huge...love the bathroom and the services...I was given free access to the club lounge...the restaurant serves very good food...the spa at the hotel is very relaxing and nice environment
1580,"I recently visited JW Marriott Hotel of Mumbai with my father to attend a business conference. The conference was good. The food was very tasty. I also saw the full hotel after that. Poolside area was the best. All the latest , luxury amenities was there. The stay is expensive here. The hotel is beautiful and good for photography. We had lunch here. I wish to stay here."
1581,"Stopped by for cocktails as I had heard a lot about the J W Marriot, I was not disappointed, exquisite service from a waiter and Gaurav Chauhan(Chef) Amazing cocktail and Beautiful location in a window seat looking over the harbour. Amazing to escape briefly from the chaos of Bombay"
1582,"I only stayed here one night (arriving at 7pm and leaving at 7am) on my way from Pune to Dubai, but the service was excellent and the room was comfortable, luxurious, and clean. I'll stay here again when I have more time to explore the amenities and the beach. You'll want for nothing."
1583,"The location is the USP of this hotel as most of the other luxury hotels nearby are towards the airport or at the other side of the city. This hotel is in the middle of the city and sits right over the Juhu beach which is just a few seconds walk away. Ocean view rooms are also available that can make your in room stay quite pleasant. The rooms are nice but I found them a bit old fashioned and I have stayed at other Marriott properties and found them more modern, spacious and vibrant."
1584,Checked in late night after an overseas international flight - the concierge welcomed us like long lost family and escorted us to an upgraded beautiful junior ocean front suite. Our 5 night stay was wonderful and kudos to the exec lounge staff in helping me with dealing with local Fedex issues for releasing medication that my wife accidentally left home in the US  The quality of food in the exec lounge was outstanding - the service was just superb  Thank you JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu for making our visit memorable. We will certainly be back.  A 5++ star rating..
1585,"J W Marriot Juhu is awesome place. Next to Chaupati beach, location is excellent. Nice clean property with ample greenery. Their restaurant is famous, food is awesome. Rooms are well clean & nicely maintained. I had good time here"
1586,"JW Marriot Juhu is a beautiful property with fantastic services and amenities. Particularly, for party lovers, the place is outstanding because the hotel staff is very patient and equipped to deal with any kind situation. Getting to the hotel can be a bit of a pain in the peak hours because the traffic around the hotel is bad."
1587,It is already a five star hotel. But from my perspective I loved it because the staff was helpful throughout my visit here & they all seemed to be believing in the virtue of humanity. I'm sure none of the staff would mind going an extra mile for the guests indeed.
1588,"I went back in July with family and had a blast.  Neha and Siddharth the managers on the floor are the absolute best. They will do everything to make sure that guests are comfortable.  This hotel is unbelievable for spotting Bollywood and famous cricket personalities.  Ran into Kapil Dev and took a picture. My kids spotted the famous actor Mahesh Babu and they too went and spoke to him.  Lotus restaurant is absolutely the best for breakfast. While there, make sure to ask for Vikram. He is the most friendly guy there and very pleasing."
1589,"We stayed at the JW Marriot, Juhu from 15th to 18th July. The property is located centrally in Mumbai.   The rooms were a bit small from our expectation, but overall clean. We were upgraded to a higher category with an amazing view of the pool and the beach.   The buffet breakfast was the highlight, it's well spread and the chef was quite receptive of our tastes.  The Bombay Bakery Company has an awesome selection of breads and pastries. Must visit. It is part of the hotel.   Overall a satisfying weekend getaway."
1590,"i visited in Lotus cafe with my friend. The cafe has a nice cusine. Too many option lots of cuisine to offer. i specially wrote  this review for Chef Gaurav Chauhan who made our dinner normal to v.i.p with his excellent treatment and knowledge about food recipes starter to till dissert. he is one of the best we met. mutton were the best in overall dinner. Overall the best place and the quality food. As a reviewer, I'm a fan here. It's rare to watch a place do their thing for so many years and still find them excelling. I guess this is one such. again thanks to Chef Gaurav all the best for your career."
1591,"Loved eating as this new Pan Asian lounge bar. I couldn't locate Dashanzi as a restaurant on Trip Advisor , hence am writing a review in the hotel section . The food , the decor , the ambience and the service is top class . The menu - innovative and chick . A must visit place"
1592,"Staying at hotel was worth it!! I was visiting my 7yr olds and my friends... And we all had an awsme time. Service is extremely courteous and they extended my stay in just one call!! No hassel no worries... Also my daughters had wonderful time in toddlers room. The staff esp Ms. Neeta and one more lady there took such a good care of them that the next day my girls wanted to stay back there instead of shopping wid us!! At short notice they arranged for d babysitter after the toddler room service which was commendable. In all I wud highly recommend it , and was really happy staying here"
1593,"excellant hotel in one of mumbai's best areas, the hotel is the ulimate in hotel luxury, rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated, the staff treat you like royalty, the aneities are excellant, you have got to stay here even if its once in a lifetime."
1594,"Though this hotel is 14 years old,and looks dated from both inside and outside,the service is awesome and most of the staffs are extremely courteous and nice,barring a few in the reception area. Will explain below,in details I was there from 8th to 10th July,2016 for an Trauma Conference,and checked into Room 428 on 8th July afternoon. There was an ever smiling young lady wearing specs and a whitish dress,loitering in front of reception area,who asked me if she can be of any help. I told her,I am there to check-in,and have been there for the Trauma Conference. She was amazed and asked me,whether the conference was held in this hotel !! I told her,unfortunately yes !!I wish I got the lady's name from her name-tag. Quite well informed she was,apparently. Second experience at the"
1595,"It's a worth visiting Hotel..no complaints,services are at their excellence. As it is over booked many a times,it is advisable to get your bookings confirmed. Food qualities are at their best as usual. Infrastructral facilities are awsome. On time facilty for pick up and drop. I would rate 4/5 stars."
1596,"How do I start to explain. First of all, the hotel amenities are exceptional. Lets start with the rooms, big and extremely comfortable. At least 2 layers of fluffy-ness. Bathroom has sliding doors to integrate to the room or keep it close for privacy.  The hotel is enormous, but notheing like the amount of things to pick from the breakfast buffet menu. I can say hands down, one of the most exquisite breakfasts I have had in my life. Be sure to grab the freshly baked croissants.  The pool was exceptional. and I give the service overall a 5 star review. Attentive and fast.  Eventhough I did not myself hit the gym, my partner found it perfect. WOULD DEFINETELY RECOMEND."
1597,"We had a very comfortable stay at this hotel in June 2016. Excellent staff, very courteous all along the hotel. Good sized rooms,clean and comfortable. Breakfast and the bar were very good. Nice pool and gym too. Overall a great experience. Would recommend this hotel brand to one and all."
1598,A friend got married in Mumbai and he had us all staying at JW Marriott - we spent 10 nights there.  My best part of the stay was the breakfast- had such a huge variety I would sit there for almost 2 hours eating the scrumptious food. We however didn't have lunch n dinner there we would always be out.  A couple of functions were held at the hotel and the arrangement and hospitality was fantastic.  The bars in the hotel were up to the standards! Although the air conditioning was just too high in all main areas. The rooms I thought were quite small however pretty!  The staff were very warm and would do anything you'd ask them to! The service overall was as per standards. Plus point I got to meet a few Bollywood stars at a launch they had there! So lucky!
1599,"This one is a complete waste of money time and experience. Will not recommend it for anything..really pathetic! service , the rat hole rooms, the dirty smelly corridors..I wasted almost two hours to check in and was moved to a stinky cabin kind of room, there was no one available to ask for a change.. I waited and wasted my entire day. Finally had to call and cancel my appointments for the day. Hotel is pathetic ,service is worst. If at all the sea is a respite big then church gate has better properties..  I would rather stay at chateau Windsor at church gate. That's not even a quarter the price and one of their floors looks exactly like this one.  Worst trip to a mumbai ever! Thank you JW Mariott! Now I know what to avoid in the city"
1600,Had a wonderful visit at JW Marriott. One of the best hotels I have visited so far. Awesome location & great facilities. Friendly & Courteous Staff. I truly recommend this hotel for stay. I am sure I would.
1601,"Words will be less to describe this beautifully managed luxury property. Nice location. Walking distance from most popular place of Mumbai Juhu Beach. Near by restaurants for food. 20 mins drive from Airport.I have been upgraded to suite room, so had a direct sea view. Swimming pool area has been very ascetically maintained. Buffet breakfast spread is vast and delicious too. Service as with any JW marriott property is splendid."
1602,"It is amazingly shocking to know that a 5 star hotel like JW Marriott has a 2 star service to answer their customers on the phone and conduct a simple activity with no success over the last 6 weeks. It is amazing to understand that after paying a large sum to stay in a beautiful hotel at JW Marriott Juhu, that they have paid a very small sum to ensure that guests like me do not have a 5 star service online. Is it that JW Marriott only gives 5 star service when you stay with them and everything else is. 2 star service?  I have stayed at the Marriott in Juhu between the 23rd and 28th April and expected the reception staff to add my Marriott reward points when I checked out and they stated that they would. For your knowledge I have also stayed at a Sheraton Starwood hotel and they"
1603,"I had another fantastic stay at what is certainly one of not only India's but the world's great hotels. Room 289 looks out on to a gorgeous expanse of the gardens, the pool area, and of course Juhu Beach the beautiful Arabian Sea. Strolling through the lobby and down the sweeping marble staircase, into the restaurant, being accompanied each day by a classical pianist, or a traditional Indian raga band, is just such a smile-inducing and uplifting part of each day, and it never gets old! Treat your self to a stay at JWM Juhu. And by the way, if the hotel is fantastic, the staff is even better. Its my home away from home, and what a treat every time."
1604,"With the brand name, I expected some glitz and glamour, but unfortunately it left me somewhat disappointed. Against such a huge property, rooms were suprisingly small, service was mediocre and the staff a little sad. I have been to other Marriot hotwls, and am a big fan, hence if I have to compare this with the others, this one was plain drab.  The only good thing about the hotel I found was the location. Full marks to that."
1605,We stayed only for one night and received excellent service at check in and transfer to airport. Breakfast was sumptuous and service was very good.  Rooms had good facilities and bed very comfortable.  They make extra effort to keep up the worldwide reputation of JW.
1606,"Very Good Hotel Near Juhu Beach. Food spread was good and taste was also good. Staff's were co-operative.  Overall a very good hotel and located at a very good location.  Entrance, Building inside, Pool & all the amenities are really good."
1607,"This is a modern, clean and classic hotel in Mumbai. All amenities that you expect from a JW Marriott. Spotless rooms, stylish decor, attentive service are all here. Rooms are quiet and well appointed. Large and modern bathrooms with nice products. Food is great and has amazing restaurants to dine in for. Never a wait for elevators or for the front desk staff, which were all very friendly and hospitable from the time you Check in until you say adieu.."
1608,"I stayed here in May for three nights whilst on business in the area, rooms were very spacious, extremely clean, food was great and the hotel staff could not do enough for you. I would definitely stay here again."
1609,"This property has a nice entrance with a amazing chandelier. The cafe has a nice cusine to offer on a weekday like Thursday its was almost full that's says it. Too many option lots of cuisine to offer like Thai , Japanese, western and indian with good choice of live counters like pasta stir fry but bread & dips bar was amazing. It was simply made with good tasty dips & good bread selection. Chefs are always there to help you Harpreet was one of them, but chef Aniket one of the best we met with his good passion about the food and selection of cuisine really liked the salad and pasta on his suggestion. Woffel were the best part of dessert. The girl on counter(couldn't remembered) was very attentive like ajikya who was service us. Overall the best place and the quality food &"
1610,"Stayed in the hotel for two weeks while on a business trip. The room was spotless at all times,food really nice. Vast variety of dishes from all over the world. Staff really professional and helpful. I really felt welcome. Thank you Tresa, Lavinia and Herpreetsingh. Your hospitality is much appreciated."
1611,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 weeks in May, while on business.  I think it is the best place to stay in Mumbai.  The location on the ocean was beautiful.  Beach access is protected with a guarded gate.  We always felt very safe.  The pool area was wonderful.  Attendants were very helpful and brought cold water and misters and we could order drinks or food.  There was a pool with a slide for small children, molded lounge seats in the sides of the pool, to relax in the water, also jetted areas and a separate salt water pool.  We used the gym daily.  It had a big variety of equipment and ample machines.        The included breakfast was superb, with lots of variety.  We usually ate upstairs in the executive lounge, where you could also get custom omelets, dosa, and a wide"
1612,I am huge Bollywood fan and it was a one of the main reasons that I decided to check into this hotel for the very first time and it has lived up to its reputation every time I have been at this property every since then. No surprises that this celebrity like place is very often frequented by who's who and I was fortunate enough to meet many of my favorite celebrities here. Hotel has an amazing lobby with a wonderful Lotus cafe where breakfast is lavish. Special thanks to Chef Mehta for helping me in my dietary requirements.  Amazing rooms compliment the awesome Juhu beach view. Sunsets are worth waiting for and feels great every evening. Samantha has always been very welcoming and made sure I had the rooms to my liking. Sufiyan and Evan were always a delight to have a nice
1613,Stayed there for few days last week. Excellent hotel with awesome services Every penny spent there is worth Sea view rooms are excellent Food and ambience world class Can rate it as one of the top hotel in Mumbai
1614,"This is a tired hotel in a decent location, but very crowded. Juhu is a good area, with Starbucks etc... But traffic is very bad on an evening, when it seems like half of Mumbai are trying to visit the beach.  I was disappointed with breakfast and much prefer the Renaissance in Powai.  This is an ideal hotel if you like pigeons as there are soooo many of them."
1615,This is my third visit to the hotel and it was quite nice. The decor however needs a facelift considering the excellence displayed. I want the housekeeping to also work on laundry services on Sundays as the usual excuse is that it's a weekend. This is an international brand not a local hotel. I love the meals provided as it is international in standard.
1616,We checked into Marriott Juhu for a week.The room was very spacious and comfortable with a breathtaking view of the sea. Hospitality was excellent.  The breakfast spread was something to look forward to.  The buffet spread at Lotus Cafe for both dinner and lunch is worth mentioning..amazing food and value for money!! Unfortunately we had no time to try out the other restaurants ( Mezzo Mezzo/ Saffron/ Spices and the new addition Dashanzie) so that's in the check list for our next visit! We really had a great time and we are looking forward to our next visit to this beautiful property.
1617,"It was my first visit to the Marriott Mumbai , & a friend of mine suggested the Saffron for a good Awadhi meal. It was a memorable experience from the time you enter the hotel whilst greeted by the smiling faces at the front desk. The food was delicious & the service was outstanding. Especially the service is a major plus point, unlike other places they don't try to overdue it. Hope they maintain it. Will surely suggest to my friends & family."
1618,"A one night stay for a business meet starting early next morning is not enough to give a complete review for this grand property located Just at the Juhu Beach. Though it gives a feel to take away memories with guests.   I appreciate the ambiance, may it be lobby, restaurants, rooms, pool or at the conference facilities. The live Indian Classical music makes the evening very pleasant. Enjoyed the calmness & de-stressing feel of it.  Rooms, though small are an example of excellent space utilization as I found every space for my need & every thing on place I needed.      Wide range of food gives a certain choice for every one & I appreciate the aroma, taste & live counters...  Good greens & a direct access door for Juhu beach adds value to your free time..  Overall a wonderful"
1619,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Overall it was a good stay as the property is big and beautiful. With 3 swimming pools and 1 especially for kids. Though the kids club is only for toddlers and the rooms are small for families with children. Buffet dinner has very limited choices for vegetarians. It was the same menu on both days in breakfast and dinner at lotus cafe, which was disappointing. The staff is nice and cordial."
1620,"Was there on a business trip last weekend. Had a horrible experience at the front office.   The Front Office executive charged (instead of blocking) Rs. 45K on my card. When asked the next day while checking out, the then FO exec informed that it will take 21 working days to refund the money. I didn't accept it & strongly protested. The gentleman took some time, consulted his bosses & then committed, being a Sunday we cant transfer it today hence the money will be refunded next day/ ie Monday (27 Jun 16) - This hasn't happened yet (Till now). Money didn't get credited yesterday. Hate to follow up & play the whole sequence, explaining again over the phone to some or many execs there - hence chose to write it here....make the Marriott world sensitive about it!  You just can't have"
1621,"Hotel is situated near Juhu beach, which is nice, only if the beach is cleaner. I had a seminar here with Emirates and really enjoyed my stay here. Services are good, rooms are excellent and food is awesome. I'd give it 5*"
1622,"The hotel is situated on Juhu beach within easy reach of the airport. My appointments were to the north of the city which meant that the location was ideal, particularly in that I had some free time at the weekend. The hotel itself was comfortable and clean with a nice pool area and garden. The breakfast buffet was good, although despite the best efforts of the staff struggled at peak times .It was quite a trek to some of the tourist attractions to the south as the traffic can be heavy. Overall, an enjoyable stay."
1623,By far the best hotel in Juhu. At the beach offer various restaurants of different cuisines. Arola is frequently visited by celebrities. Got a chance to meet deepika padukone. Rest the hotel provides a very modern ambiance. Ideal for corporate dinners.
1624,"Enjoyed my stay. Great service, great food and room-service. Good location if you need to do business in the airport vincinity but want an athmospheric neighborhood that allows for some strolls in the area and of property restaurants. Beach is not for swimming but walks are nice."
1625,"Well JW Marriott is an awesome and lovely place to stay.  Food is awesome  Some staff is not that much friendly except few and JW must do something for it as if guests are paying for the service they should be treated with smile and with respect.   Rooms are spacious  Take 5 floor rooms, view will be awesome"
1626,"I was here for my mom's birthday celebration. Thoroughly enjoyed their mouth smacking ,finger licking food. Great teamwork along with their great hospitality. Special thanks to chef Nishad Sebastian for his kind gesture. So all in all it is a must visit for all :) Specially the Weekend Brunch recommended by Chef Nishad Sebastian.          Regards,   Aishwarya"
1627,"The hotel seems to purely rely on its location. Everything else was super disappointing given its supposed to be a premium property. The whole place is dated and desperately needs renovation. The food is terrible, I tried two different restaurants and in one the waiter was sick and in the other the food was served cold. Also, cutlery and dishes were unclean and service was incredibly slow in one of the two restaurants. All I can say is that I am shocked and I would not recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a five star experience that the brand name promises."
1628,Went for a stay in my 8th month of pregnancy .. May first week .. Found the rooms very average for a Marriot property . Size of the room was small and so was the bathroom ..rather smaller ! The bathroom dint have a tub which was pretty surprising .  The best part of the hotel was the swimming pool area ..they have a seperate baby pool very well made with a slide etc . My 3 yr old was thrilled ! Even the adult pool had temperature controlled water and the staff around were extremely helpful. The pool area had a gate leading to the Juhu beach with good security system and clean beach side only for the hotel residents.  Coming to the food ..I will give a 10 out of 10 . From morning breakfast to snacks and dinner buffet the spread was massive . The chefs on live counter taking care
1629,"The room was nice. a bit tight but the view was fabulous. it was cleaned everyday and it was done with care.   Window: Opening the window was not permissible so to get any fresh air was not possible.    Bathroom: the bathroom design seemed to be strange .although it was a unit divided into three sections there was no privacy in any of the sections. so if  you are two single people sharing the room , a single person is in the shower the other single person cannot use the other two sections because the doors are transparent glass.  Rope: There is also no hanging rope to hang your clothes if you hand washed them.   Jet Spray/ hand held shower: For those who like to wash themselves after using the toilet.  Shelf: Perhaps a shelf in the toilet area may be of use to the user. if they"
1630,"I was here for my Dad's 60th Birthday celebration with my family. Exceptional service by the team. Beautiful rooms, great food and humble associates made our stay more eventful. Thank you so much for your lovely hospitality and those delicious chocolate cakes which not only sent to our room but was also accompanied by two of your lovely associates who sang the birthday song for my dad. Family had a great time at Saffron restaurant, Lotus Cafe and at the Quan spa. Special thanks to the front associates and the restaurant servers who took special care of our young one. Hospitality at JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu is very exceptional. Me and my entire family had a great stay and will certainly be back.  Warm Regards, Shreyas Kale"
1631,"We stayed at JW Marriott as a couple and i must stay..It was more than amazing..The room, the service, the WIFI, the ambiance everything was just excellent..It was our Anniversary, so we had a bottle of wine, a cake and a bouquet of flowers were waiting for us at the room.The Breakfast Buffet in the Lotus Restaurant was also amazing."
1632,"On my previous trip to Mumbai, I had stayed at a hotel that used to be nice (the Renaissance) but I vowed to try another hotel for I was not going to stay in the place again, bad service, rude staff, etc. I selected the JW Marriott Juhu, since it was somewhat close to the airport and the reviews all sounded great and the photos were pretty impressive. Sure enough, this hotel did NOT disappoint. Absolutely everything was fantastic. From our car service that we reserved through the hotel, to check in, to any guest services items I needed. Everything was professional, pleasant and just plain delightful. The hotel wait staff was in my opinion, exceptional. I had the pleasure of staying a full week, and it was nice that they would start to remember you after a few times in the same"
1633,"Loved every bit of the stay , we were in group of 12 Pax , ( 4 family with kids of age between 7-14)  we all have a blast at the hotel , in all together we stayed for 8 nights .what to say The Food/ the rooms/ the ambience / all are exceptional .... The kids were not ready to leave the hotel . the pool was the major attractions for the Kids / the beach access from the hotel was great for morning walks on the JUHU beach ..... Choice of the Restaurants are great , but the best we all loved was the LOTUS CAFE ( the all  day Dinning ) . Overall the best experience we had and love to come back again and again ........ .."
1634,"I've been staying in the hotel for so many years with a platinum member. I can say the service has got bad to worst. Dialed at your service and requested for the same shampoo(Forest essential) that was given to us when we were at ocean suite last month, the lady who answered the phone kept my call on hold several times without even telling me she will, gets back on the call and said the product is not available for now. When i asked her which product, she said bvlgari (Marriott doesn't use bvlgari here) , unprofessional attitude to lie with confidence is not acceptable in service industry especially hospitality. She then said she will have the house keeping manager call back in 5 , its now been 30 minutes and im waiting to go for shower but nobody has called it yet. Would have"
1635,"Iv stayed in this hotel after a very long and hard business trip all around India I stayed there for 2 nights it was the perfect relaxing spot after a long week of daily trips around India the food was perfect the room was very good with a nice view , the only down side that it's on the beach but there is no accesses from the hotel to the beach"
1636,"Enjoyed morning breakfast , it was an experience one should not miss if u are a foodie as it has a lavish spread. I was not only stunned with the delicacies but also a breathtaking view when you enter the grand lobby with the view of the ocean"
1637,Loved every bit of my stay. Kids were thrilled with all the services . Food was exceptional during buffet in all day dining during dinner. Room service was very good in terms of timings .   Thank you for lovely family time would definitely love to recommend.
1638,Had been here for Father's Day brunch awesome spread roasts and desserts on the buffet were the best I have seen in a long while. Very good selection of cheese and cold cuts. Indian food is top notch as well. There is a separate kids buffet area as well which keeps the kids engaged and well taken care of. Great music and lively place. Definitely going back
1639,Fantastic location with beach right behind and having a direct entry on to the beach. The rooms are spacious with a good view of beach and swimming pool down below. The food was not up to the mark may be because I attended a conference
1640,Good food & service with professional staff.good view of the restaurant.one must visit this place.all says about the best seafood they serve in the city & best quality of food & service.will see you soon back.keep up the great job.
1641,"On my recent work trip to Mumbai I stayed at this beautiful property overlooking the Arabian Sea . The hotel is located in Juhu and connected well to other parts of the city . The rooms are well appointed and with everything that a business traveller would need to feel ""home away from home"". I stayed in a room on the second floor of the hotel overlooking the pool and sea . It's a busy hotel,still the team engages with you and offers help on each available opportunity without intruding on ones privacy. The breakfast in Lotus Cafe was good,balance of international and local food on the buffet . The service was attentive and crisp . The best was the Chef's promptness to help and his suggestions for food . The gym was equally good with modern Technogym equipments . Special mention"
1642,The hotel is near by the Juhu beach. The Services and the rooms are too good. Staffs were too friendly. It has many restaurants. It also serves buffet. We have been to North Indian Restaurant. It was very nice experience. The food served was very delicious. The services are very nice.
1643,"Stayed in hotel on 10 th ,11 th and12 th June.Rooms are spacious and we'll maintained.Had a view of swimming pool and beach from room.Excellent view.Food was excellent .Staff very courteous .You can have a beach walk in morning and evening.Refreshing experience .Very big reception area and dining hall.Overall Excellent Experience ."
1644,"This hotel is really showing its age, mould on walls, filthy rooms and to crown it all we contracted food poisoning from the Bombay Cafe. When we reported this and pointed out that the chicken pie, quiche and pies are all sitting out under a domed container with no refrigeration, the manager simply said to us 'would you like me to call the chef so you can let him know this'. I replied if you have a chef then he should know standard food hygiene procedures and they should be followed, we spent 2 days in bed due to this. We have visited Mumbai on several occassions this was the first visit to the JW Marriott and will certainly be our last, there are many more excellent hotels in the area such as the Oberoi which is a fantastic hotel and spotlessly clean with amazing rooms."
1645,"We have taken the membership at JW Marriott which entitles us to a complementary night stay on a weekend, amongst other benefits. So, we picked our complimentary night on a Saturday and here goes my experience:  1. Room When they offer you a complementary night stay, no one points out that these are on reserved rooms which have pathetic or no views. These are basically the rooms that if as a guest you were paying and staying, you would ask your money back and leave. We had a window on one corner of the room as an excuse for an outside view. Needless to say, there was NOTHING worth viewing and it was better that the curtains were instead drawn down.   The room isn't very spacious but is quite cramped up thanks to the large sofa next to the bed, near the study. The bathroom has a"
1646,We stayed for one night at the end of our trip. The location is great as you can access the beach. Breakfast is plentiful and varied. Lovely swimming pool and gym facilities to use. The rooms are spacious and well kept.
1647,Stayed here for 2 nights in the lotus suite...the suite is very well designed and big enough...loved the bathroom...you get awesome spa services here...the breakfast spread is very big and lots of options for breakfast available....beach is closeby
1648,I was attending a social event at JW Mumbai.  Fantastic location.  Great view.  Best restaurants and bar Comfortable and luxurious rooms.  Located in Juhu I must say the best hotel to stay if you want to stay close to sea and party places in Mumbai.
1649,"I have had problems here every single time I have come to this hotel. Staff are rude, the service is nothing like it used to be. Management here is a big problem, complaints do not get passed on or resolved. My husband waited 45 minutes for breakfast - and only received it after we reminded them. The service is appalling all round (especially the executive lounge). The lounge is the worst we have experienced. Such a shame that this place not what it used to be, mostly due to staff attitude."
1650,The hotel is perfect and the service is amazing. The front desk manager has helped us a lot despite a small problem the first nice. He is Gaurav and made our stay a wonderful one. Wassim at the desk also was very cooperative and helpful. We will definitely go again. Rooms are super modern and the food is amazing and fresh
1651,"stayed in jw marriott juhu what a pleasant stay it was,didn't want to return home ;-) attentive staff  good food at the lotus cafe. rooms are a bit small but the view was very relaxing & the amenities are good. had an awesome weekend wud definitely visit again cheers"
1652,"good place right on the beach. excellent place to stay if one is looking to get wet in the beach, have chats and golas. the rooms are smaller in size. better to take a club room or an executive suit, you get picked up from the airport in style, a BMW 7 series, or a range rower. or an audi."
1653,I travel regularly to Mumbai and have always stayed at the JW Marriott.  The location is brilliant for shopping and it's relatively near to the airport.  In the traffic it can take anything from 2-3 hours to get to the Gateway to India or to some of the other Taj hotels however this can be done in a day trip to that part of town. The restaurants offer a diverse selection of food and the buffet is a hit not only with guests but locals too who enjoy the live cooking and various culinary delights.  I love the breakfast here and on my last visit I had the opportunity to use the pool and do some sun bathing with the spectacular views of Juhu beach.  I've stayed here over a dozen times and never had any issues with staff or food or service.  Looking forward to my next stay..
1654,"Felt like had some issues with the service‚Ä¶  Arranged with the hotel for Airport Pick up‚Ä¶but they failed to be on time and had to wait around 20 minutes outside the airport for the car‚Ä¶  Up on reaching the hotel had to wait for around 15 minutes for the check in as there was not enough staff at the check in counter‚Ä¶  Room was small‚Ä¶very clean and tidy and very well maintained. Good quality bathrobe, tooth/shaving kits were available..  Excellent view of Juhu beach from the hotel. View from the main restaurant was also excellent‚Ä¶very good options were available for the breakfast‚Ä¶better to avoid the south Indian dishes (like Dosas etc‚Ä¶) as they weren‚Äôt up to the mark.   Very good options were available for lunch as well. Their Salad options were excellent‚Ä¶restaurant service staff"
1655,"My stay was amazing. The pool area is pristine and so relaxing. I would come back here again and again. The staff, in particular Abhishek at front of house are extremely helpful and accommodating. The room are spacious and have a ""wow"" factor. the breakfast is lovely. You feel you are staying in pure luxury."
1656,Got married at this hotel..! the place was brimming with life and the room was amazing ..! had some trouble with the cooling but it was sorted out..! the service was prompt and  perfect.. the spa was ultimate pleasure and the poolside deck was heavens .. the buffet was unparalled.. This hotel is very high on quality and staying here was absolute pleasure ..! Look forward to longer vacations at this one .!
1657,"JW Marriott on Juhu beach is a real nice resort like hotel on the Arabian Sea. The lobby leads to ,and has a fantastic view of the ""sunken"" restaurant one level below the main level and a all glass view of the pool and the Arabian Sea. Absolute best hotel in Mumbai for ambience, views, pool, access to beach, etc. You feel like you are in a resort.   Far better than the new JW Marriott at Mumbai airport which might be more modern from a room amenities perspective, but doesn't compare for its architecture & ambience."
1658,I stayed in Mumbai and dined in one of a restaurant in JW Marriott the food is exceptionally great along with the services .I had a huge expectation that last for no longer !! Because now my expectations are even higher you people maintains the standard bravo!!! would come again !!!
1659,"The hotel was amazing, the infrastructure is royal and elegant. The lobby and ambience for lounge is relaxing. The hotel has a vide choice of restaurants to choose from. I liked the chinese food served here, there is also a disco for dancing. The pool is very relaxing and has amazing views. It directly opens to the Juhu Beach so you will have that experience as well."
1660,"Excellent stay at the hotel- great grounds, super close to the beach, lovely views from the room. Also enjoyed the hospitable service My experience to the hotel: 1) Duration of stay- Visited Restaurent 2) Room Interior- NA 3) In room Dining."
1661,"This property is beautiful, and the staff goes above and beyond to please. From the front desk staff (Noel, and all of the others), to the Spa staff (Leah, the staff there, and the Spa Director), I experienced nothing short of world class service during my stay. They recognized my Marriott Platinum Premier status, and ensured they quickly climbed to the top of my favorite Marriott properties list.   My stay was short, but I was able to squeeze in quite a bit. I hired a local guide, Mukund from CarLink, and saw everything I wanted to see in Mumbai in one day. The second day, I relaxed at the JW Marriott Juhu, and enjoyed everything the hotel had to offer. The executive lounge is wonderful, with a chef there for breakfast, and plenty of amenities available throughout the day."
1662,Stayed on a business trip for 3 days. Property is amazing located centrally. Rooms are large and clean with ocean views. Services are prompt a thumbs up for that. Breakfast buffet is good. Found the lunch and dinner average which was a slight disappointment considering the Mariott brand. Overall a good place to stay.
1663,"Check in and check out did not go smoothly. Bad beginning and bad end. Not what I expect from a five star hotel. Our upgraded room was nice although it smelled of damp (and our clothes smelled on returning home). It also had a good sea view. I have no complaints about the buffet breakfast offered in the Lotus restaurant nor about the executive lounge, to which we had access. Attention from waiting staff in the Lotus restaurant was erratic, though. Housekeeping was efficient. A five star hotel with no shop? That was an inconvenience and a surprise. Being a leisure guest, I was well satisfied with the hotel location and the pool area. The spa was great. It was also a real pleasure to have fast, free wifi (One benefit of joining the Marriott loyalty scheme). Would I stay again? I"
1664,"Our trips to Mumbai are for purely medical reasons, and we tend to stay at the Jw every time. It's convenience since its close to our doctor's clinic. My daughter and I have had innumerable issues every single time. Right from the dusty rooms, hair in the cheese, under-cooked food, cold food in their speciality restaurant, our sheets not being changed on the day it's meant to be,despite the fact I specified that my daughter had an oral surgery and I would like the room, sheets and towels to be spiffy. My daughter and I are severally allergic to dust and we mention that each time while booking our room, yet the rooms are downright dirty. Hair and hairpins belonging to previous guests are an ordinary thing to find here, amenities in the bathrooms unreplenished happens all the"
1665,We had a room facing the beach and was really fascinating! The staff was really cooperative and super friendly. All the needs were patiently listened and were made sure that we had a perfect stay. Worth the money!
1666,Awsme service n product by trout n bar grill. Musoorrie. Felt happy n happy only the nice staff.  I Was so glad to c the organic procedures of the co. Hotel . I liked the system of business . Would like to rank 5 out of five.  Gud wishes.
1667,"My experience to the hotel: 1) Duration of stay- Visited Restaurent 2) Room Interior- NA 3) In room Dining - NA 4) Breakfast- NA 5) Sleep quality- NA 6) Location- Juhu Beach 7) WiFi- NA 8) Room tariff- Search by different web sit for discount/ Direct rate costly 9) Transportation- Online cab available quickly, Airport- 25-40 min away depend on traffic  Stay Recommendation- Prefer If, beach lover & big property lover  Thanks"
1668,"We visited the marriot in April for a meet and it surpassed the reputation in terms of luxury and comfort.  Rooms are very modern, Spa is excellent, Service is excellent. Food can't comment much as it was fixed limited menu."
1669,"""The most lavish food and wine I had ever had "" excellent food ,service and wonderful ambience .wait staff is very knowledgeable and comfortably helpful .i was there for 3 hours due to some change in flight with my friends  .best location .though I did not make any reservation but I was seated promptly .and how can I forgot the server name Deepak Shettigar who  helped us in suggesting wine and food,from entering the restaurant till leaving the restaurant.i would love to visit Romanos again and again ."
1670,"Excellent stay at the hotel- great grounds, super close to the beach, lovely views from the room. Also enjoyed the hospitable service by the hotel staff who were always eager to help us with everything we needed, very friendly and courteous, which made the stay incredibly wonderful. Loved the food at the Lotus Cafe too! Highly recommended for your stay here, you will not regret it."
1671,"There's not much I can say that hasn't been said about this hotel. It is magnificent. The buffet breakfast is like no other with so much variety that it's very difficult to decide on what to have each morning. What stood out for us during our stay were the staff. Vaishali who was our housekeeper went beyond to keep us happy. Her work standard is tops and a lovely personality that made us feel very special. For turn down service, Deepak was there every evening to make us comfortable. Sunny & Warkar in the restaurant knew our preferences by the second day so we rarely had to ask for anything. On the whole, this hotel stands out for us because of their excellent customer service."
1672,"Great location, by the beach, you can almost forget the chaos outside! Outstanding quality of service, very friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet. Rooms were spotless and the pool was opened until late which I found very handy as too hot to go during the day. Staying at the Marriott Juhu will probably spoil you for life as your expectations for hotel services will be much higher."
1673,"So spent holi weekend here this here. Big faux pas as they had a holi party which was supposed to end around 2pm but finished at 6pm. Just by the pool. So the smell from the colour, etc. was just all over the place. And then the guests who played holi, decided to jump into the pool though after washing the colour off. Well kinda.  The other odd part was that they gave us a room on the smoking floor after telling informing them well in advance that we had kids with us - we had taken two rooms for two families. And the smoke odour was in the room so they couldn't even hide that. The front desk was at a loss so I created a stink. Their defn' of service recovery was to give us 50% off a meal at the hotel which, even by NYC standards, is not cheap. But not to look a gift horse in the"
1674,The service and experience was first class. World class infrastructure. Rooms are not that spacious but the facilities are awesome. Breakfast buffet is great. The most amazing thing about this hotel is the swimming pool. Do not go to the Juhu beach. Just enjoy your evening at the swimming pool. Everything is just so clean and shining and sparkling! Loved the stay!
1675,"Hospitality was amazing. Ms. Neha, thank you for walking the 2nd mile to ensure  the stay as smooth and comfortable as possible. The late checkout was a great help too. Mr. Senthil goes all the way to ensure I tried all the different Indian dishes. The lounge became more warmth and like a home abroad with you around. Awesome hospitality. And Mr. Priyesh for making the lounge as enjoyable with your creative cocktails. These are 5 stars customer service aptly for a 5 stars JW Marriott.  Thank you all for making my stay a lovely and memorable one."
1676,Good property Specially the location is quiet good as its on the juhu beach.The staff is also very nice my room was upgraded to beach view.The food was just average the variety of food in dinner buffet was less and had a very bad experience of dal makhani at dinner in buffet on regular complaining it was not considered. Overall experience was good but it could be excellent if food was good and service was prompt....
1677,"The JW Marriott is nice, but now it needs a push, because the quality has degraded over the years. Still it is a top address. Service is on a really good level and  always friendly. Hopefully Management will push to go back to the level it was."
1678,"I am a regular visitor to Mumbai and j w Marriott  always wins my heart .. Service , staff to ambience and most imp they do understand your stay .. üòÄIndeed my favourite  Hotel.... Much much recommend place .. To  experience you have to be here ... Thx so much to all yours efforts .üëçüëçüëçüôè"
1679,"I've been staying here off and on for over 6-7 years now. The hotel is still a good venue, but the room quality has degraded over the years. The rest of the hotel is still fine and it's worth a stay if you've never been in the area. The service is good all around except perhaps for calling the operator/front desk from your room. The phones are cordless and need replacement. The wifi is very good. The mini-bar is not well stocked, but they have a choice of a coffee press and Lily espresso machine - so awesome in the mornings. The closet area and anything made of wood has degraded and needs some touching up or replacement. The lobby area is huge and the breakfast buffet is diverse - same for the dinner buffet."
1680,We live here due to my boyfriends job and we love it. Everyone of the staff members are amazing. They treat us like family they haven't seen in years and are so excited to see us. Chef Senthil makes us wonderful tasty food every morning for breakfast. Thank you JW for all you do.
1681,"This was my third trip to JW Martiott and again outstanding service throughout. I could not fault it at all - just superb service. I need to give extra special Thankyou to Sayed our driver ... What a lovely gentleman, really looked after us and helped with everything we needed in our trip for the day. JW are lucky to have just great employee. I really look forward to visiting again."
1682,A nice comfortable hotel. Stayed here a few times now. Good food and good ambience.   Nice pool and bakery. Very central in Juhu. Helpful staff. Rooms are slightly small and dark.   Overall a good stay. A nice and luxurious family hotel with good facilities.
1683,"I had early flight and i need to check out at 6 in the morning, i asked them to pack the breakfast for me. When i approached to check out at 6am, they seem like don't know i have ordered breakfast, it took 15 mins to delivery the breakfast box to check out counter. But overall the hotel was good, huge, room very nice, clean, food was good. There were a lot choices at breakfast buffet."
1684,"I am a business traveller to Mumbai and really like this Hotel for its amenities, ambience, service and its location. It is right on the Juhu beach and has some beautiful views.  The variety of food is good; try the Italian restaurant for some great authentic Italian preparations."
1685,"Luxurious hotel, one of the best properties in Mumbai.Lovely pool wonderful dining options, huge rooms stylishly built and furnished. Staff is extremely helpful and courteous. Since it is right on the beach, one can walk through its gate for a nice walk on the beach"
1686,I stayed two days at this hotel in Mumbai and I have stayed a quite few JW Marriott properties over the last few years.  This property is truly a first class hotel and the staff is just second to no one. The property is just about one year go and everything is new and fresh.  The room I was in was decorated very well and my view was great as well!  My choice hotel when I am in Mumbai for certain!
1687,"This is easly the best property that you will find on juhu beach..  Rooms are clean, sheets/towels smell fresh, service quality is excellent, gym is good and food quality is ok.   Fact that this hotel has the most celibrated disc in town 'enigma' make sure that the crowd moving is of excellent quality. Now come to the best part - pool is outstanding and back door opens to the beach."
1688,"Beautiful hotel bumped into some actors it was an amazing experience I would definitely recommend the hotel the rooms could be a bit better but it's definitely somewhere you would want to revisit. In terms of Bombay ,Bombay was great if was really hot"
1689,Excellent stay. Being a Gold Marriott member I was upgraded and hence it helped a lot. Overall the lobby and the pool is amazing. Also Lotus Cafe area is excellent. The staff service levels were below par but then the property itself is so grand that it super cedes other negatives.
1690,"My fianc√© and I stayed at this hotel for three nights.  The location is great -- on Juhu Beach and close to restaurants and shops, including a Starbucks across the street.  There is a wide selection of restaurants offering almost any type of food you can ask for, and the quality is great across the board.  The lobby and pool areas are very welcoming and great places to hang out.  The hotel has a fleet of clean premium cars (A6, 7 series, and Land Rover) and the drivers are fantastic and very knowledgeable.  Ask for Manoj if you need a driver to take you sightseeing, shopping, etc. --  he knows all the best places!  The room was clean and well kept up for the most part, except that you could see the dust on the table, desk, door, etc. whenever you open up the window.  I called"
1691,"Great service, good food all by the sea. Definitely a hotel to visit again.  The restaurants are all beautifully done with a great ambience! Must try the Thai one it's fantastic. The Sunday brunch is to die for. Absolutely loved my stay! Has a great little cafe called bombay baking company with the best cinnamon rolls."
1692,Some great Ambiance and food at the hotel.. Gada-da-vida is an excellent place for some chilled out evenings. the Rooms are cozy and well kept. A bit small but then Mumbai is a crowded city.  Its well located near Juhu and has lots of restaurants and eating joints in walking distance.  Must visit property.
1693,"When you walk into the hotel the communal spaces are lovely and grand and the polish the reception floors every night which was a bit annoying because we were coming in late every night and there would be wires all across the floor. The outside spaces are great when viewed from inside, however when you step outside the smell is revolting and the flock of birds that circulate the outdoor courtyard is horrific. There is a medium sized swimming pool so I thought it would be nice to swim to help me relax, but NO the swimming pool it freezing cold. I understand you wouldn't necessarily want it heated because it is hot anyway, but it was far too cold and then I completely understood why everyone else never went in the pool and were all sun bathing instead. The breakfasts were great,"
1694,"Whether you are on a business trip or on a family holiday, this is the place to be at in Mumbai. Fine location, not just right on the famous Juhu beach, but also the centre of the vast city of Mumbai with plenty of shopping and dining options in the near vicinity."
1695,The place is really very nice and comfortable. The arrangements done for workshop was really very good. Food was really excellent. Overall atmosphere was very good and service was really excellent. Would suggest strongly this place as a venue.
1696,"I stayed at the JW for 4 months whilst working with a client. The service and experience were absolutely first class. The general manager and senior staff went out of their way to introduce themselves and make us feel welcome, and to arrange whatever we wanted, including a tour of one of the main kitchens and spending some time with one of the hotel's head chefs talking about his family's tradition of fine Indian cuisine.  The facilities are first-rate, including the gym, the Thai spa and the personal trainers available. The Sunday brunch is also not to be missed - among the best brunches I've had anywhere in the world - go early, order the alcohol or champagne brunch and pace yourself.  The guest relations staff were wonderful, arranging outings and trips for my wife & friends"
1697,"Spent a weekend here between business trips, I chose it for its location on the beach, having visited it for meals when staying in the area previously. My room, although not spacious, had a lovely view of the beach. Breakfast offered a great selection including eggs made to order and some great fresh juices. had a good massage at the spa, very much enjoyed the tapas restaurant and coffee shop too. Spent most of the weekend by the spacious pool. Would recommend this for anyone in Mumbai on business or pleasure - hotel has its own gate onto Juhu beach too."
1698,"Wow, this is quite a hotel, the staff, rooms and service are just fantastic.The breakfast is the best I've ever had in a hotel, and the rest of the food was fantastic.  I ate whatever the chef's recommended, and when I overdid it on the spices, they gave me the right recommendations to get everything back to normal.  The locals will tell you, and you must listen, do NOT swim on the beach.  The water is fouled, and not safe.  Swim at the pool, and go for walks or runs on the beach.  If you go running on the beach, to the left you stop at the sea wall, and to the right you stop at the last hotel.  To go further in either direction is unpleasant.  Bottom line, I would not stay in Mumbai at any other place."
1699,"We were really spoilt with the service and friendliness of the staff in Kochi and we did find that the staff were very professional, helpful and courteous but missed the smiles. We were offered the option to upgrade our room and we didn‚Äôt take it ‚Äì wish we had. the room we were given was nice but very cramped. It was however clean and well maintained. Security athe the hotel was really good and reassuring. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel was just so good. so many options and so many made to order stands. loved the service. even when it was busy we didn‚Äôt have to wait for long for the food.  Location of the hotel is perfect for shopping at santa cruz, getting to the airport and the beach. if a family member hadn‚Äôt have told us that we could access the beach from the hotel then"
1700,"Usually when ever I come to Mumbai I stay at this hotel. This trip prior to checking in at the jw marriot I stayed at the Taj lands end for a few nights to give the hotel a try and the experience and service was one of the best I've ever had. Sad to say Marriots standard has dropped ,the breakfast used to be one of my favorite buffet breakfasts in the world however disappointed with the fact they have cut down on the variety they used to serve.  The staff seem very young and lack competencies when dealing with foreign guests especially in the restaurants. The food was good but the time taken for the food to arrive and service was really slow. On the positive side rooms are great,the hotel facilities are really good and if you are a Bollywood fan you are sure to bump into stars."
1701,This was our first stay at a Marriott hotel but unfortunately based on our stay here we are very unlikely to book with them again. We stayed one night before an early flight the next morning and we had booked it to see the beach and to be close to the airport. One the day we arrived there was a really bad smell from the ocean which convinced us that there is no need to stay close to it even for the sea view. Check-in was busy but nice service. The lobby was covered in a smokey smell from the restaurant below and there is a serious need for an air-vent. Our room was like any business hotel room and not in any way cozy. The pool did not seem fresh. As we had an early check-out we ordered breakfast to go. We spent a good 10 minutes discussing the various options for juice and
1702,"The site of Arabian sea from the room and the calmness of beach made me stay back for a day more without doing anything. It is TERRIFIC. Check in was fast, room, food and all other service was good.  I dont why they put NO CREDIT and was asking payment for small small things. I and my son had buffet lunch from LL floor on Friday, forgot to sign the bill. But on checking out, I told the receptionist ( Mr. Puneet) that my lunch bill is not included, he checked with restaurant and they told there is no dues for Rom no. 569. Please take care of both.   Also my room was little too far from Lift as well as fire exit. In case of an emergency, it will take the toll."
1703,"Bought 2 day passes to use the pool and pool services. Great pool and view of the Arabian Sea. The club sandwich and pizza along with lime sodas are reasonably priced and very tasty. The lime soda was refreshing, service very good. If you already have a place to say in Mumbai, getting dome rays by the pool is affordable and a great way to relax."
1704,"My experience with Marriot has always been pleasant and has always set a benchmark for all my hotel stays, needless to say after this last stay I might be re-thinking the Marriot brand as a luxury hotel service provider. I took a red-eye flight and landed early, very early, while I understand it is the policy to charge for the hotel room for an early check-in, all the previous Marriot's were courteous enough to for-go that formality, given that I am a Marriot rewards member and checking into one of their suites. Despite the suite being empty they told me the best they could do was give me a base room rate for the room, or I could wait 5 hours. Again while I understand this is the policy, all the other Marriot's I have stayed that had the five star courtesy to provide the room"
1705,"Second visit in 2 months. Room was ok. Lights intermittent, telephone overly complicated,  mini bar very limited selection. Breakfast. Eggs cold, toast cold, fruit juice excellent.  Service overly fussy and annoying- not relaxing at all. Swimming pool small. Gym very good.  Evening Restaurant s very limited and quality of food does not bench to other leading hotels in India.  I hope my stay in JW Marriott  Pune is better. I cannot recommend this hotel when the quality, attention and customer experience is so much better in ITC and Taj. This will be my last visit to this hotel."
1706,"Booked this hotel despite reading all the negative reviews!  Glad I booked as the stay was more than perfect from Check-in to Check-out...it was flawless. We got upgraded to a Sea facing room which was nice. The rooms are very compact though and not having a balcony felt a bit claustrophobic, but having said that the room was well organised space wise and had everything. Although there is water shortage in the region, we had no problems with hot & cold water. The toiletries they provide are very good from Aromatherapy Associates. The Hotel is on the popular Juhu beach and has direct access which was great. The hotel grounds although small in area is kept well and has 3 pools. The breakfast spread was very good with plenty of options to choose from and live cooking stations."
1707,"Stayed both at the Courtyard Marriott for 7 days and then at the JW Marriott for 12 days while overall the experience was decent I still had some issues on the place.  Drive in - this is full of the JW cars parked on both sides which at times leaves just one lane for the guest cars coming in and out. This would mean the the guest would have to wait for the car rather than the other way around.  Breakfast - the staff needs to take a leaf out of the Courtyard staff, while no one was rude or any of that sort, just no smiles on the peoples faces serving you and having to wait for your table or order or even to get the attention of the staff..  Room Service - took almost 30 minutes to get just a pail of ice that too after 3 reminder calls.. colleagues staying with me at the same time"
1708,"Wonderful hotel. Amazing location. Great service and best staff ever. We traveled thru many Indian cities and stayed at many hotels, but this hotel topped them all. We had a bit of a nick up as we had an early check in but management staff made it a good experience"
1709,"MUMBAI: The Twitter tag of JWMarriottHotels ‚Äî ""Life‚Äôs greatest luxury can simply be having the time and space to call your own. Here, find inspiration, and discover the room for the exceptional to emerge"" ‚Äî is bang on! I am a fan of JW Marriott worldwide and make it a point to stay there fit in the city Im visiting because the management pampers guests with personalised attention, state-of-the art facilities, luxurious accommodation, sumptuous food‚Äîand the most hospitable management. So when my flight to Delhi was postponed to the following morning, last week, I called JW Marriott Sahar and within a few minutes, was taking through a quick check-in process. Its location‚Äîadjacent to the International airport‚Äîmakes it ideal for travellers which is why I chose to stay here instead"
1710,"After a loing break i stayed at the JW Juhu. It was a long stay for business purpose. of course, the lovely pool by the sea was a refreshing way to end the days work. While the property is old,, it is still very well maintained.  The Leadership have done well to train their staff and motivate them. i was particularly impressed by Front Office and the Lounge Team. They were very personal and yet very professional in their work. The rooms can be better, if you compare it to newer properties.  The only place i felt there was a scope of improvmemnt was in the housekeeping department. It fell short of standards set by Taj and Oberoi"
1711,"just wait around the corner but yet not visited several times heard restaurant Mezzo . The ambience was cool and the food side view was not very fine I'm in once you are in the evening but rest other things like the food portion taste and  the service is as par as Mariott stands for. The quality of the food served was really appreciable unlike other hotels where you don't find a taste specially the star hotles ,  this hotel definitely provide you a good European and Italian pizza .  The chefs and the waiters and the service is awesome must visit and try  Mezzo at Mariott"
1712,"I was in Mumbai for a wedding and stayed at JW with my teenage son for a few days before the event.  My overall impression was good.  It's a grand hotel with wide open spaces..all kept secure behind a wall with plenty of security.  That said, as a mom with a teenager I was not comfortable venturing out unescorted and felt that I wish there were more offerings ""inside"" the hotel for shopping, small snack cafes or entertainment in the evenings after a day of touring. The morning breakfast in the Lotus cafe was astounding.  We really looked forward to mornings.  The service staff with very kind and the selection of food was amazing.Many Indian dishes that I've never seen in the US.   We did not try the cafe at dinner time...I regret that.  We had access to the club lounge but by"
1713,"This hotel has been our favourite for years!! Being Gold card members we are always treated well.The staff in the Executive Lounge especially  Priyesh and Prashant always exceed there service..In Lotus Cafe the staff are exceptionally well mannered and again exceed in their duties too,especially Manager Aniket and chefs Nishab and Mehta,always there to please and make sure you are comfortable. We visit this hotel two to three times a year and are never disappointed with the service provided.."
1714,"Good hotel, excellent ambience. have good variety of restaurents. One should try out the Bombay bakery which serves one of the finest breads.Very central and one can relax at the beach facing view. One of the best bruch served at its coffee shop."
1715,"During my recent trip to Mumbai, India, I received an upgrade (courtsey GM, Mr. Nambiar) and enjoyed outstanding. Starting from the person welcoming at the front door (Pankaj), reception area (Akanksha, Vinny), Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner (Mr. Oneill, Rameez, Bringston), Housekeeping, Spa, and everything else that I needed was served with smile. Kudos to Mr. Nambiar for managing the staff and the hotel so well!!"
1716,"Went on Sunday which was quite ,so we got complimentary  room upgraded.  Good quality free wifi in room.  Bathroom and toilet has glass screens , which may not be to everyone taste how ever we later discovered they had wooden  sliding screens which you can use for privacy. Slight negative was no balcony and quite a long walk to the room from the lift. How ever on the other hand , received great , faultless service from front desk to room cleaners which made our stay more special.  Be sure to check before hand if they have any special deals like airport pickup and breakfasts at discounted rates and access to Executive lounge , which we only found out at check in which was too late as we had made alternative arrangements.  Beach outside is public , and can be accessed via a door"
1717,"JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu The lobby is gorgeous, you step further in and past the grand piano are two sweeping staircases that announce your presence into an elegant dining area, which overlooks a coloumned and breathtaking swimming area, followed by the actual beach. The food is spectacular and made to individual request and taste. The clubs and bar exquisite. And the rooms are perfect, literally the best shower I've ever stepped into."
1718,"Stayed here for a couple of days during the WT20 world cup. As a large party check in took a while, however it could have been much quicker if they attended to one person at a time.   Rooms however are lovely and very comfortable.  Using the restaurants at any time is a headache in itself. The queues for breakfast are horrendous. I waited 40 minutes for a table one day. By the time I got seated and had a look at the buffet the breakfast had ended. We ordered lunch a couple of times and the normal waiting time for a meal is about 45 minutes. This is even when there were only 4 of us in the restaurant!!  The pool area is lovely and clean and a nice place to relax. Again if you are ordering food you will be waiting a while.  One big issue was the amount of salt used. I asked for no"

1720,"Being a Marriott Platinum, SPG Platinum, Hilton Honors Diamond, I've stayed at many properties around the globe. Loved the JW Marriott Juhu and it's a fantastic luxury hotel centrally located in Juhu where many bollywood celebrities live and frequent the hotel regularly. Stayed for 5 nights in a Grand Oceanfront Suite with fantastic ocean view. Got personalized greeting card from GM and box of sweets from Bombay baking company inside hotel - nice touch. Suite cleaned twice a day & fresh fruit kept in room every morning and evening. Used hotel limos (BMW 7 series) 4-8 hrs each day throughout my stay - fantastic service and highly recommended. I have fallen sick even when eating in nice restaurants in India. Never had issues eating at any of the restaurants at JW Marriott Juhu. I"
1721,"I stayed at the jw juhu for a business conference from 21-23 April. This hotel has a major hospitality issue. Right from check in to check out, they were completely off!! As a member of the ritz, this hotel feels the exact opposite of their flagship brand."
1722,"Luxurious, beautiful and best possible location in Mumbai with all the boxes ticked fine. Just needs to pick up a bit on hospitality part more. E.g. If a guest complains that the fruit served in room Is rotten, it's expected to be changed and not just being acknowledged. Some words of greeting never harms any guest."
1723,"Wonderful interiors, very good service and some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's Mezzo Mezzo Restaurant for the exquisite seafood dishes. I ordered Pesce Spada a la Ghiotta and it was perfect."
1724,"I had visited reflections of JW Marriot on Wednesday 20th April 2016 at 19.15 hours, the bar of the hotel for an evening meeting with 2 others . When we asked from the menu for mandarin flavoured vodka along with other items , the bearers came back and said only one large of the drink is available though they have other bars he could not get the same ,unless they were restricted due to local law. Bar menu for food did not havechoices for vegetarian of my like . Therefore I ordered simple vegetable salad . This came after 45 minutes totally dry asif it was cut in the morning . When I ordered for my next drink a cocktail , it was not served for very long time and when I checked when I noticed it was not given for some time when checked, I was informed that his  colleague could not"
1725,"The Juhu is beautiful.  The d√©cor, the location on the Arabian sea-with a huge beach in which to walk, layout or enjoy the ocean-and the accommodations are first rate.  However, the best part is the main restaurant.  The morning buffet is spectacular.  As an Ex-Pat working overnight on US hours, having ""breakfast for dinner"" every morning of my stay was a huge treat.  The Indian cuisine was extensive, authentic and extremely tasty.  They also did a very good job with the Western dishes, too.  In short, my visit to Mumbai-at least during my stay @ the Juhu-felt more like a vacation than a business trip."
1726,"It was a little bit more expensive than what I had wanted to pay for a hotel room but in the end it was worth every penny. The staff was very good, room service was a slow and the house keeping was very good.  The check in process was expedited by Devidyuti and after a horrible trip, it was a pleasure.  I think I would like to stay there again for more than the 2 days that I spent there...."
1727,Awesome experience i mean its jw Marriott of course mumbai didn't have the same experience in pune but thus was great. Live counters were good in the buffet  cheese which is my favourite and deserts just excellent. No complaints there
1728,"During my stay at JW Marriottt hotel, two outstanding people amongst the staff made my trip a memorable one. There names were Satish and Aniket. Although I only met Satish when I ate in Lotus Cafe, he provided me with exceptional service and delivered my food in a punctual manner. When I asked a waiter for bread and he did not bring it, I asked another one. This one didn't bring it either so I asked Satish and he brought it before I knew it! I made sure I remembered this so that I could share it with you all. Then came Aniket. He first delivered my food/breakfast when I felt too lazy to make a Nutella sandwich myself. He delivered it with the crusts off and the bread cut in to two pieces; Just the way I like it. Everyday he delivered it 2 minutes after I arrived for breakfast"
1729,The hotel has amazing location to the beach and Juhu!   The breakfast has more options then you can dream of.   The other restaurant are really good well.   The rooms were well equipped though slightly small.  This did not take away from the great experience.
1730,"Was at Saffron last night with 7 friends. When u r visiting a restaurant two nights consecutively it surely is the food that beckons you there. We started with Shammi  n Gelloti kebabs, which were just melt in the mouth, n murgh nawabi tikka, which had a bouquet of taste once u bit into it. The main course was Ghost Ki Nihari, where the gravy was stupendous where the lamb was falling off the bone marrow being so well cooked, this was followed by murgh baradari, with a thick base n finely cooked spices, the best after the rest was the lamb Biryani which in all its glory was the real thing, n not just rice n lamb cooked in pressure cookers n passed off as Biryani as so many of our other good hotels r known to do. Here the real Rockstar is the Chef Shahnawaz Qureshi, who has common"
1731,This hotel is right on Juhu beach.   Good hotel if you plan vacation or business visit to Mumbai. Though the beach is not really clean the hotel premises is good   You get sea view for almost all the hotel rooms   The rooms are relatively smaller but well maintained
1732,"Perhaps the most memorable hospitality experience in all of our travels. Beautiful property, excellent location, impeccably maintained facilities. Superb breakfast buffet, clean and spacious suites with all amenities, and (3) swimming pools with secure Juhu Beach access. Despite these superlatives, the most impressive elements at this property are the service and culture of the staff. GM Pavithran Nambiar, Chief Concierge Noel Sumitra, Executive Assistant Ami Panchal, and Lotus Cafe Manager Vinayak Patiyal were the pillars of exemplary hospitality during our memorable experience. We will only be staying at the JW Marriott Juhu Beach in our future travels to Mumbai."
1733,"Excellent property located in the heart of Juhu. Very courteous and polite staff.. Very wide breakfast buffet spread, nice cozy rooms with ample lighting.  Even their cars and chauffeurs are very polite and friendly who drive their luxury cars for pickups."
1734,"This is such a beautiful property. We had the most pleasant stay! The pool is so nice and the sea view is breathtaking. Staff is always friendly and efficient. And of course, the best food and treats to be found in the restaurant and cafe. Totally worth it."
1735,Since it was our anniversary we decided to stay at the J W Marriott hotel in Juhu for a couple of days to just chill out.    We were lucky to get a lovely ocean facing room which gave us a breathtaking view of the sea and we were treated to a spectacular view of the sunset.    The rooms are simply wonderful and the service by the hotel staff is so caring and courteous.    Special mention must be made of Mr. Sarfaraz at the front desk who was so sweet in arranging a complementary chocolate cake and flowers for us when he came to know that it was our special day!!! We were touched by this gesture and have become loyalist of the Marriott hotels for life now.     Also the experience at the lotus Cafe where we had our meals is awesome as this restaurant has the best ambience in the
1736,"Was a short but excellent stay! The room was lovely, and the public spaces were calm and relaxing. The restaurants were truly fab. It was my partner's birthday while we were there, and we ate out at Mezzo Mezzo. On informing them to bring a surprise cake, they brought out an amaretto shot platter and a sizzling brownie with candles - on the house! The food there was some of the best Italian we have tasted ever."
1737,"Spent 12 days on company business at this hotel in March this year and could not fault it. The security was good, and attention to detail was visible. The staff politeness at all levels of this hotel was 1st class from the waiters to cleaners and front desk. The food was excellent in all the restaurants and cafe. The pool was clean and hotel grounds were secure and well maintained. Enjoyed the trip so much I would return for sure."
1738,"We stayed here twice over 2 weeks. My partner is a platinum elite so at the forst check-in we expected and upgrade as there was rooms available but we did not get this and were told by employees that rooms were not available...! We were not happy but let it go as we were only there for 2 nights to begin with. The hotel is lovely, hidden on a busy street behind huge walls. The people at the entrance are friendly and made us feel very welcomed. I found that people working behind desks here are not so friendly. It's hard to get a smile out of them. The room was nice, very modern but lightening wasn't great. The room was very dark but the bed was super comfortable. The breakfast here was standard and what you would expect in any hotel. I found the hot food very oily but I couldn't"
1739,"Excellent service, very friendly staff. The garden and the pool are beautiful. Has got lovely view of the sea and the beach. You could spend the whole day in the lawns and at the pool.  Negative - rooms are small for the steep price you pay"
1740,"I have been staying at the Marriott since it first opened more than a decade ago. The service levels are excellent and the public spaces are good but the rooms are in dire need of a face lift. The rooms are quite dim and the white marble in the bathrooms are turning brown in certain areas. It just looks very dull when compared to the plethora of options available to todays traveller.   The hotel has its regular guests & Marriott loyalists, but for how long will they be able to hold on to them is anybody's guess. The location is very very good. If they refurbish the rooms then i doubt many hotels would be able to compete.. Breakfast buffet is quite good but I'ver had better in Mumbai..  I stayed at the Oberoi last year and it was one of the best hotel experiences, but to come to"
1741,Stayed at this property over the Easter weekend. It was fully packed.  The location is superb and the views are stunning! The staff was very helpful. The food was fabulous. The only thing that let the experience down was the spa. The staff were rude and the service wasn't upto JW Marriott Standard.  There were long queues for breakfast. So please go early for breakfast.
1742,"First time at this property, stayed two nights April 3-5.  The hotel has a beautiful lobby and reception area, but this is where it stops. Once you head towards the rooms it looks like the management forgot about their guests.   The corridors outside the rooms are old with worn out carpeting and very poor lighting, resulting in a dark and gloomy look. Also a very weird smell permeates throughout the corridors.  What is very surprising is for the size of the common areas the rooms are really small and tired looking. Broken lamp shade, chipped and dented bins and counters etc.  On the positive the staff is very friendly and the hotel has a great breakfast spread."
1743,"Stayed twice in a period of two months, each time for about a week.  I have mixed feelings about this Marriott.  (1) Many staff members are wonderful service providers.  The few exceptions are in reception and concierge positions.  (2) Several restaurants are quite good.  I enjoyed the Italian and North Indian especially.  The general restaurant is always busy and provides a good breakfast buffet but a mediocre al la carte menu.  (2) The two different rooms I stayed in always had a musty smell.  They were a bit cramped and the bathroom configuration just didn't work.  You must open a glass door to the toilet and another right beyond it to the shower.  Small spaces.  (3) With my second stay I had access to the executive lounge, also ""long in the tooth.""  (4) Pool is large and was"
1744,"Even though I have stayed in US for over 50 years, I was born and raised in Mumbai. I make yearly visit to see my family in Mumbai and have most of the time stayed at this property and they have been great. However, this tie, our stay was incredibly enjoyable. The staff's can do do attitude especially Devi Gosh, the Front Office Manager reflects the commitment and high standards set my their GM Pavithran Nambiar, From details on picking us up at the airport to the minute details for rooms and our other needs were handled in a classy way. Thank you Devi for making this one of the most memorable stays for our family at your property. We will be back."
1745,"This place has gone down hill very fast, the rooms are filthy. Mildew is all around the bathroom, it was disgusting. The food at breakfast is vast, but flavorless. Same things saved daily. Location is great if you want the beach. I personally loved the St Regis. Lounge was okay, again no kids allowed."
1746,"I've stayed at this hotel many times, but over the Easter weekend, it was packed to capacity - it was still a great stay with good service provided. In my view this is the best hotel on this side of Mumbai. But the hotel has got to sort out the Executive Lounge - when this first opened the food and service was first class. The food has certainly depreciated - it's actually pretty rubbish compared to what you get at the other big chains in India - sort it out JW Juhu!!"
1747,"I didnt actually stay here i was staying at Taj Palace in colaba. This review is about the food at the coffee shop. Luvly beverages, amazing buffet with lots of indian cuisine, beautiful cakes , pastries.yes absolutely luved those pastrys and cakes, the few times that i've had the opportunity to eat at this spacious coffee shop thank you. Even though its a packed coffee shop everytime, few times ive been there on my travels to india, The Hostess has her cool and  tries her best to provide a comfy table. They also use lavaza coffe for their coffee based beverages. One has the option to either  just order from the whole day Ala carte menu or choose the buffet spread. Thank you JW Marriott."
1748,The rooms are well done . The swimming pool offers is kept clean and offers respite in the hot weather. The breakfast by far is the best time for me at the hotel. The staff always are ready to do the sunny side omelette or anything you like .The lounge offers good place to meet some clients.The place is in the centre of the city and it works for people from all over the city can easily come here.
1749,"This hotel is ideally located(at least considering my work place). Stayed here for 3 nights and was my first stay at this hotel. I have tried couple of other hotels in and around Juhu but I am glad this place is what I was looking for and will stay without doubt during my next visits to Mumbai. The most important factor of this hotel which makes it beautiful is it's staff. I have stayed in many hotels and have been regular to a particular brand and very well know it makes a difference as a traveler. You receive that extra attention, my basic needs are always taken care and you get a special treatment but as a first time visitor lot of hotels miss on these factors unlike JW Marriott Juhu which surprised me right from entering the hotel. Reception staff is very courteous and"
1750,"I am a frequent business traveler to Mumbai and stayed in the hotel for my first time this trip for 6 nights and relied heavily on the hotel facilities - business lounge for meetings and breakfast, restaurants, bar, laundry and even tried out the spa area. The service team cares about the guests and have excellent customer service but improvements are required and some may not be possible. A peaceful nights rest is a requirement always and particularly when dealing with jet lag. There are two towers in the hotel and one sits directly above the banquet rooms and this is the tower I stayed in. The sound from the banquet hall reverberates up the tower and can be felt and heard in the room even on the upper floors until about 1 in the morning. The banquet business in the hotel is"
1751,"My wife and I have been regular guests at this hotel but this was the first time I was staying with my kids, aged 5 and 3.  The Premium Club room was spacious, good enough for us.  The stay overall was exquisite.  Each time, the staff here seem to better their already brilliant service and they truly succeeded in making this trip special.  I have stayed at JW Marriott locations in Bucharest, Washington DC, Pune, Dubai and have travelled and stayed with other major chains in the Middle East, Africa, India, the US and Europe but this hotel is special.  There is something extra special about the genuine warmth and attention to detail that the staff here displays.  From the airport pick-up to the check-in, the room service, concierge, pools, restaurants, the lounge, the access to"
1752,"We stayed over at jw Marriott juhu for around 3 nights and my word what can I say. 5 star environment and very friendly hotel staff. Will assist you immediately with anything u want. We had a slight problem with the payment as we had paid cash and money was deducted from the debit card. As soon as we notified the hotel staff about this we were immediately introduced to the front desk manager and she took it upon herself and made sure she sorted it out for us, and surely she did so immediately.  Apart from all this rooms are absolutely brilliant and well maintained. We had breakfast included when doing the booking and it was definitely one of the best we have had. A wide variety to chose from. Quite frequently the hotel was visited by Bollywood stars and this was absolutely"
1753,This place has a team of really warm and comforting staff.. Very Helpful and always at your Service.. This made the two day wedding also a wonderful one..  For food had the high tea arranged in the banquets.. that was very well done..  looking forward to come back soon.. thank you team JW marriott Juhu..  And they have great internet bt at a cost.. bt worth it..
1754,"From our complimentary airport shuttle (not your bog standard car / bus) throughout our stay all staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive. This was booked as a special treat for my Mum who is unwell and the hotel very kindly upgraded the room - thank you! The buffet breakfast was overwhelming and offerred a fantastic selection of foods as well as gentle live  music, and the staff were very quick to clear away plates etc. The pool area was well kept, clean and felt comfortable despite the mix between guests for both business and pleasure. Would recommend the Executive lounge, which provides a 'High tea' and 'Canapes' as well as pre-dinner drinks (at set times) as well as complimentary soft drinks throughout the day. We had very much enjoyed our stay (one day still to go)"
1755,Beautiful hotel located near the airport. The location isn't ideal as it is nearly an hour from all the famous sites and clubs... But it is very beautiful. Great grounds and amenities.   I recommend this hotel strongly.
1756,"The JW Marriott is grand to look at right from the moment you set eyes on it from the main gate. Security ensures you remain protected with sniffer dogs scanning each vehicle entering the premises, while the security officials carry on their tasks yet managing to squeeze in a 'Namaste' or Indian greeting to you with joint hands!  The hotel itself is spacious and grand for the first time and regular traveler! Although it has been around for quite some time, the decor still is in grand opulence and is world class by any standard - better than the other properties I have seen at least in US and Europe.  Do try and get a room facing the pool and the ocean as this is the most pleasant view and something to add flavor to your stay no matter how long you remain there. Being regular at"
1757,"Nice hotel, very grand. Nice rooms, good breakfast spread, attentive and helpful staff. Italian restaurant in the hotel was also good. Good choice in Mumbai. Felt a bit out of the way, quite a distance from our office but then distance is relative."
1758,"Great location on the Juhu Road, perfect for airport and central locations to explore.   Hotel is traditional-style with some of the rooms being recently upgraded/refurbished. Ocean-view rooms are good, some lower down rooms are a bit on the small side so try and go for an upgraded Exec room.   Restaurants are good with a well-stocked Buffett option too. Room service is pretty good, with an extensive menu. Exec lounge is pretty average for food, although the drinks on offer look good.   Gym is really good and the pools are typical for this style of hotel.   Definitely a 4-star, OK-service and good concierge.  My view is that this is a great business/conference/stop-over hotel."
1759,Well maintianed. Good property. Good pool area. Excellent location.   Food nothing to die for. The breakfast was  excellent. The main course wasn't up to my expectations. The taste was average.  Rooms were clean and well maintained. Sleep quality was very good.  Overall a very good property.
1760,"We booked to stay over the easter weekend.  I was told that the sea facing  rooms would not come under the easter package and would cost much more. There would be no cash credits for our stay unlike the rooms without a view (I was informed that there would be no view at all!) The room was small, no balcony.  The free cake which was offered on arrival has not yet arrived. I am still awaiting it. Perhaps I need to remind them again."
1761,If there is one hotel in mumbai which still holds its luxurious uberness then thats J W marriott based in juhu mumbai. It still gives you the feel of walking into something grand only made for exclusive class. Simply the best.
1762,We stayed at the JW Marriott for three nights in November after some friends recommended it to us. We had a great stay there. We only had one full day to see the highlights of the city and wanted to make the most of it. We arranged a driver from the hotel to take us on a day of sightseeing. This was the best thing we could've done. Rajesh was amazing. He had a lot of knowledge of the city and made sure we covered everything including some shopping. The hotel breakfast was amazing and the pool area was great to chill out in. I would definitely stay here again if I were to come back to Mumbai.
1763,"The hotel is located right on the Juhu Beach. The grand entrance of the hotel will give you an idea of the awesome stay it's gonna offer.  The rooms are big, and my room had sea view. Opening the eyes in the morning virwing the vast sea was a pleasure.  They have a huge breakfast menu with several cuisines. Despite of rush, the things are well managed.  The hotel is frequently visited by celebs, u might end up seeing/meeting one if u r lucky!!  The fitness centre is decent and they have an open pool on the ground floor.   The proximity to the airport and good service makes it ideal for business travellers.  The proximity to the sea and splendifurous setvices makes it ideal for pleasure trips."
1764,"What I love about the JW Marriott Juhu, apart from the lovely location, is the pool.  I've never really got too much time to spend by the pool, but during my last visit, I spent a good 3-4 hours at the pool side. They have three pools, all unique in themselves.  The service at the pool is also great. We had breakfast at the Lotus Cafe which was awesome. The biggest buffet breakfast in Mumbai. The rooms are very well done, albeit a little small. But enough for two people. The room service food was above average, but overall, we had an excellent stay, and look forward to going back soon."
1765,"The Marriott Mumbai Juhu made my first trip to this colourful city a truly memorable experience. I was there with four family members including my nephew and his fiance who were there to do some wedding shopping. From the moment you step through the main entrance, you are greeted by warm friendly smiles from the staff. Check-in was a breeze -- and so was everything else as we found out during our 5-day stay at the hotel. Rarely will you get a ""no"" from the staff to your request, and even if they can't, somehow they will find a way to please you and and meet you half way. Always book your stay with breakfast, otherwise you will regret missing out on the wonderful spread comprising both local and international dishes. There are so many 'live' cooking stations that your main"
1766,Coincidentally landed on my birthday. Excellent reception. Upgrade to highest category. Overall excellent experience. Good food and chefs at very interactive. Noel and Nishad were too good. Family leisure business. It serves it all.
1767,"Never having been to Mumbai, I appreciated the fact that the hotel sent a car to pick me up at the airport at 4:30am at no charge.  That was the start to an excellent stay.  I received a room on the Executive Level upon arrival, not having to wait even though it was 6am.  The room was facing the beach and though not large, certainly adequate.  The executive lounge was excellent both the service by the staff and the food.  The evening cocktail hour really was like a full meal. I greatly enjoyed the fitness and health club.  They have a sauna, steam room, large whirlpool and even a cold water pool.  The staff in the health club was excellent again responding even before I asked. The driver of the hotel was excellent and took me to my meetings quickly and always got me to my"
1768,"In Mumbai there are many hotels and we have stayed at quite a few over the years but none shine like the J W at Juhu. This is part due to the setting (off the beach) but mostly due to the impeccable staff. From front desk managers  Puneet and Deepika to Lotus cafe manager Aniket and all his crew including Chef Mehta, Parag (who is just Awesome) to Manu, Sumeet, Puneet and the Whole staff make a visit like no other. We stay in India for 30 days every year and cannot vouch enough for this hotel. A seven star hotel in service, ambience and value for money."
1769,"I revisited this hotel after 8 years. Myself and my sister were here to do shopping for clothes for my sisters wedding.   This used to be THE best hotel in Mumbai - a Bollywood star hotspot, hip place to hang out and enjoy. Not any more!   You have to go through a security channel every time you enter the building.   The hotel itself is lovely. Well maintained. Staff are very friendly and approachable.  I felt I was ""bamboozled"" into upgrading to the executive lounge for an extortionate cost 3500 per night (¬£38) - information was given at breakneck speed and not made clear. I wanted to treat my sister to a nice relaxing time before her wedding.   Don't bother with upgrading!!!   It's really not worth it. Don't forget there is a city tax and a luxury tax charged per night too -"
1770,"Escape from the Mumbai craziness at the JW Marriott. Excellent facilities, decent rooms and good food make this a solid choice for business travelers in the city. Spices Restuarant is excellent for large gatherings with private rooms available and the breakfast choices in the main dining area are great. Enjoy English soccer at the bar while you down a Kingfisher or two."
1771,If you want a night out with lots of loud music and dancing then this is the place to go at the weekend. They do not allow big groups of men so it is a mixed crowd inside. Do not go if you do not like oud music and places with lots of people.
1772,"It is a beautiful property but the customer service lets it down. My car was debited wrongfully and according to the hotel they have done the reversal on 11 February 2016 but its over the 15 bank working day clearance and its still not reflected in my account. After sending numerous emails an making calls I have had no joy.Puneet Arora has told me he needs to check with the bank (9/03/16) and will call me back still waiting. I called on Friday and spoke to Samantha Periera, still waiting for her to call me back. There is no follow up from their side, I have spoken to the Manageress, Deepika Kukreka  and still waiting for her to call back. I have left a message for a 3rd Manageress Akansha Singh, still waiting for her to call back. Hopefully I get a response after this post, but"
1773,"Decent five star hotel straight on Juhu beach (lovely for a walk) Rooms, decent style nicely decorated. Not top Breakfast, buffet style. Food good,   Venue not so much, large hall able to seat hundred+ people. Very noisy and missing intimacy and nice atmosphere (more a food factory then a true restaurant) Service good yet not top  (mega hotel style)  Food ++++ Room ++++ General grounds  +++ Price/quality ++++ Service ++++"
1774,"Any JW property in the world is great. The ones in India are awesome. So this one in Juhu, Mumbai is no exception. the property is great. The food is great, the views are to kill for. The chef at the Lotus Cafe is great. He knows the names of guests who have had issues with the food or made special requests. And that says a lot about the customer service.  The housekeeping service is another story though. Its slow...considering the hotel is huge some delay is expected. But beyond a certain point its bad service. But when the staff does arrive they are very courteous and helpful."
1775,"There are many reasons why I return to JW MARRIOT. First is the design of the hotel. I like it. Something about it cheers me up. It's personal choice but I would be surprised if you don't. The rooms are very nice and many of them have partial sea view and some have a grand sea view. Very good bathrooms and the cleanliness is too notch. Lovely coffee shop that looks on to a garden. Plus plus plus if you step out, the place is buzzing with restaurants. You need not eat at the hotel. You can just step out and there are a range of restaurants. Also a Starbucks within two minutes and a couple of other coffee shops. Since I live in Mumbai I go there for staycations and rarely leave the hotel. But if you want to, you will not be short of eating options. You can also just wander off to"
1776,"The property is absolutely brilliant!!! The rooms, views, etc. are beautiful!! My room was not cleaned properly and was full of dust. There were two oranges kept in my room, on of which was rotten and the bottom half was covered with fungus!!! There is not proper check by housekeeping team on the cleanliness of the rooms. Gadgets in the room were not working properly and the door to the toiled and bathing area was broken.  The breakfast was good and a huge spread."
1777,"Overall an excellent hotel. Lives up to its 5* Standard.  Entrance and concierge - excellent.  Reception & check in - ok, took a while to check in, a few other friends who were staying also said they had issues with their check in.  Excellent - great facilities, decor, furnishings and view. House keeping even brought fresh fruit round to the rooms each day.  Restaurants - Excellent. Staff are so well mannered and helpful. Choice of food is just as good as the taste.  Bar - great choice of drinks, spirit selections are on point.  Pool - nice pool heads straight on to the beach, also pretty quiet and a nice beach. Pool bar is good but no alcohol served.  Spa - great facilities.  9/10."
1778,"1. i visited in March 2015; and again yesterday. The bathrooms were clean & im glad someone took notice.   2. Mosquitoes: An interesting funny act noticed at the lobby was most guests kept swinging their hands left & right over their heads, and simply up & down. The moment we took seat we too started doing the same.... Reason being: MOSQUITOES.  The whole lobby was filled with it... we shifted to the bar area... but didnt help much...   3. We went up to the Arola bar... It was all empty and EMPTY.  Yet: we were asked - do u have reservations, are you guest hotel, whats ur room number? without reservations we dont attend... it was 6:30pm (incidentally a happy hour in progress & they dont allow patrons without reservations in an EMPTY place?)... !!!!  4. Another persons comes"
1779,"Staff is always trying to help or at least constantly asking, Hotel offers a number of excellent restaurants with top chefs! Pool overlooking the beach give a great relaxing feeling. Beach is not where you want to swim but the sunsets are amazing to watch from the hotel. Housekeeping does an excellent job!The only room view worth it is facing the beach (which there are plenty). You are going to pay enough just being there so you do not want to have to look at the street or another building next door."
1780,Nice cosy stay.excellent room service.all the staff were very friendly helpful n humble all the time.due to us been vegetarians daily our food was made fresh according to our request n taste.we just felt like we were at home.
1781,"Location is excellent, The service was superb. Room was good size, clean and well laid out. The staff bended backwards to ensure that we have a pleasant and comfortable stay. We have travelled a lot and stayed in 5* Hotels where one would except an excellent service. The service we got at J W Marriott was miles better than excellent and beyond one would accept at such a hotel. Any minor issues were quickly sorted out, never hesitated to apologise and any issues we had, the staff would do their utmost to assist us and looked after us so well when my wife was not felling well. The choice for breakfast and buffet dinner was just unbelievable, so much choice and well prepared and laid out. Our special thanks goes to Deepika, the front desk manager and the breakfast team, Aneekat,"
1782,"It was for a marriage function..from the check it to the chek out, it was uncordinated, hassled and time taking..despite of prior mails about each and everything, the staff just had no internal communication whatsoever..Nagesh, handling the entire booking, was unprofessional and ran away hiding from all the problems faced..all i got for my marriage present were sorry letters everyday from the hotel..!! Never expected a JW so sad..!! A huge let down.."
1783,perfect hotel to stay in case one has work in and around Juhu area. Few minutes drive from the Airport. Nice sized rooms. Breakfast was quite elaborate. Check-in and Check out process was without a blemish. Certainly recommend and stay here again.
1784,Delayed and slow chekin   Rooms are dull lighted   Food is great   Beautiful ambience   Close to airport   Nice display of decor and food will recommend it for a short stay   Enjoyed the bathroom showers   Beds and linen nicely cleaned   Will not mind to stay here again
1785,"Jw marriott is the best hotel mumbai, having excellent friendly staff.the hotel happens to also have great restaurants. such as Bombay Baking Company (BBC), not only having great food the cafe also has great friendly staff. espically Vijay the manager, who is highly effcient and hard working."
1786,"JW is good hotel to stay in mumbai, the staff is amazing and look into every detail. The hotel is close to the beach and their coffee shop has a decent view. Try for the sea facing rooms for a better view. Lots of options around the hotel for eating."
1787,"There are some hotels around the world that you really look forward to staying in time after time. This is one of them.  Great service, great food and attentive happy staff.  I would like to drink a cold beer by the lovely pool, but local restrictions won't allow it.  Exec lounge on the 4th floor is vibrant and has a decent choice of snacks."
1788,"This is located in Juhu, close to the beach.  It is a 5 star luxury property and has several restaurants and few bars.  The pool area is very nice at sunset time.  It has a grand entrance and a huge coffee shop.  The rooms are small. Good chance you may bump into a Bollywood star sometime."
1789,Excellent hotel and staff. The interior is luxuriant and yet comfortable. Not stuffy. Food and drink service is fantastic. Wide choice of places to eat from authentic local food to Italian/Spanish etc. Close proximity to the airport is always handy but not close enough to feel like an airport hotel.
1790,"The Buffet Spread at Lotus Cafe is awesome. The buffet consists of a variety of food from Indian to Italian to continental. The lunch buffet also has mixture of food such as dosa, Pani Puri Bhel Puri etc. To top the list their dessert consists of tiramisu, diff variety pastries waffles ice creams etc. Good Service with Great food and good ambience. A Must Visit!"
1791,Stayed here in August 2015 in a standard 'Deluxe Ocean View' room which was very comfortable - very good I would say. The relatively expensive restaurant was always a bit of a battle and I often used a snack facility they have there on the ground floor for reasons of both convenience and cost. This time there was a major event in Mumbai (Make in India) so my booking company had to fork out for a very costly 'Executive Ocean View' which essentially justs adds access to the Executive Lounge and free airport pickup/dropoff. I've got to say that this was excellent as the breakfasting was done there in a more civilised fashion than the melee downstairs and there is complimentary food and drink all day. This was very useful as I was often given a large lunch by my business hosts so a
1792,"I have become a regular visitor to Mumbai in last 18 months and have regularly stayed at the Marriott. I was there this week again and have nothing but compliments for it. From being picked up at the airport until the time I left, I was amazed by the personal service. Will be back!!"
1793,"I live in mumbai n i found a way, how to enjoy ur home town premium by staying overnight, so I m here for enjoying JW Marriott, Juhu, Mumbai, best location in mumbai with interesting health club n stylish swimming pool, there u can spend whole day relaxing in most exotic environment. .  Club lounge too is highly hospitalised with manger Mr Ivan taking extraordinary care of guests.  Check in was smooth with warm dealing by Neha Kapoor. . Just wonderful experience"
1794,"Although this was my first time at this hotel, the experience was not quite bad till I reached the hotel. I did arrange for an airport pick up from Terminal 2, but the car arrived 40 min late.. I was made to wait at the airport for close to 40 min.. By the time I reached the hotel, I directly went to the lobby and after checking in they apologized for the delay in making me wait for 40 min at the airport.  They upgraded be to a Suite, which was nice of them to do. It was an amazing room with a lovely sea view and a huge space for just one..   I really felt bad for just staying one night at the hotel.. I hope to visit them during my next visit to Mumbai. Its absolutely a lovely hotel to stay with amazing sea view."
1795,Hotel lived up to its image. Classy rooms very well done. Room service and food spread is excellent. Being in the heart of the city and close to the airport it's a perfect place to stay for a business traveler. Would like to come back another time for a longer stay!
1796,"Stayed at JW Marriott in mid feb with kids 9 and 5 years old. Did speedy check in for hotel but unfortunately were allocated smoking rooms which was soon resolved. Kids spent afternoon by the pool which was very clean and a life guard on duty. Next day breakfast was exceptional. You don't have to wait at the cooking stations, they take your orders and bring it to your table. Anything you want to eat, request and it will be there. Sous chef Mehta used to come to our table daily to check. Aniket (newly promoted) was very attentive especially with the kids. Kids were looked after really well and so were we. All waiters Avinash and the entire Lotus restaurant team provided an exceptional service. Ate at the Bombay baking co. as soon as we arrived and the sandwiches were yummy. Rooms"
1797,"I often visit this place nd I must say the vanilla milk shake and the caprese sandwich at Bombay baking co is one of the best I ever had..The staff(Akshata , neves) and the manager(Vijay) are great and always create a pleasing homely atmosphere.."
1798,The check in experience was fantastic. The room was beautifully done up and the view was to die for - sunset on the Arabian Sea!!! However the room was not maintained. The TV was not working and the sliding doors of the toilet were stuck. There were two oranges kept in the room and one of them was covered in fungus. The room had not been cleaned properly or checked. The breakfast spread was huge. Really sad to see a brilliant property being mismanaged to the extent that a guest does not want to go back.
1799,"First visit to this hotel ,booked by our travel agent Over the years we have stayed in many of the best hotels in Mumbai including the Taj palace and the Oberoi .Often our stays were just for one night either at the start or end of a holiday before flying .This was the case here so I can only review what we used and how we were treated .  Check in was fairly slow and not as welcoming as that of other hotels such as the 2 above .We were given our room key and escorted to the lift at which point we were just left ..We were not told the lift would only work by using the room card .Another guest saw our trouble and came to our help. The room was fine and comfortable although the wash basins the toilet and the shower were in separate areas but each divided by glass doors which meant"
1800,"Excellent service..great coffee, great food, great ambiance..super helpful, competent staff..especially Vijay, Akshita and pooja at the BBC coffee shop..Also, Pratik makes delicious sandwiches..üòÄ If you are looking for a great time..anytime..BBC is the place to go!"
1801,"I am in charge of arranging and coordinating training events for my organization which happens to be globally renowned & prestigious UK based banking firm. The delegate list comprises of staff from Mumbai as well as those from other Asia Pacific nations like Hong Kong, Tokyo & Singapore. Faculties arrive from UK and the entire event spans across 2 days.   For the month of February the event was due on 17th and 18th of Feb with guests staring to pour from 16th onward at our venue JW Marriott in Juhu. At the onset I would like to say that the event concluded with a smile on every individual‚Äôs face and I must share the success with all the staff at Marriott who toiled hard extending immense support in every aspect. I would now describe each one of them as below ‚Äì   Rooms and"
1802,"Before posting here I sent this feedback to the GM of the hotel via email and almost 3 weeks later no reply or acknowledgement at all.  Very disappointing, I thought I would give them the opportunity to respond to the feedback before I made a review on trip advisor but in this case nothing.  Myself, my wife and our 4 month old baby stayed at JW Marriott Juhu in Nov 2015, we had booked in an Executive Ocean View room for 5 nights. I have been a long term returning guest at your hotel for many years, and have enjoyed my stays over the years and have always regarding JW Marriott Juhu as one of the best hotels I have stayed, however my latest stay has left a bitter taste in my mouth and certainly was not up to the usual standard that I have come accustomed to at your hotel.

1803,"The Hotel is among the most luxurious hotels in Mumbai, India. The property is huge and the hospitality is outstanding. We had a lovely stay here and the rooms are also nice and big. There is no regret in booking this Hotel.."
1804,"Lovely hotel with a grand entrance.  Hotel car collected me from the airport in the middle of the night and I felt very safe with the driver in a place I've never been before.  Upon awakening the view from my hotel room was lovely - overlooking the pool and beach.  The weekend queue for breakfast was a bit chaotic, but the weekdays were more efficient.  The choice of buffet breakfast food was excellent, with a constant replenishment of most items while omlettes were cooked to order.  No Orange Juice on the bar, but upon asking, the staff were happy to bring me freshly squeezed juice to the table.  Coffee was also good.  Evening meals were nice, we ate at the buffet and one of the restaurants.  All the food was very fresh and tasty.  The bar we used every night knew us and our"
1805,"Spent 2 nights in Mumbai at the JW - group of 12 - 8 adults and 4 under 9's. A little on the expensive side, but the property is on the beach ( viewing the sunset from the lobby is breathtaking), with great rooms, amenities (gym etc.) and good pool area. The staff were very responsive (particularly Neha Kapoor) to address some initial issues and we had a great time.  The one unexpected surprise was the exceptional buffet breakfast. Being vegetarian, the selection was the best I have experienced and the team also went out of their way to accommodate egg free requirements. Wasim and the team should be very proud.  Overall - great stay and look forward to going back!"
1806,"We were in Mumbai for a weeks business and chose the JW Marriott.  Right from the airport pick up we knew we were in for a good time - it wasn't the usual Toyota but a lovely Range Rover.  The hotel is quite a long way down Juhu, but that's fine, there are some good restaurants and coffee shops near the hotel.  The hotel reception is huge.  It opens onto the breakfast and restaurant buffet area which was very noisy due to echoes.  It is a large space.  Rooms were excellent.  Nicely equipped and very modern.  The water felt cleaner too - it smelt like the tap water was treated.   Staff were very friendly, my only gripe was the constantly asking for feedback.  There is a choice of restaurants.  Jasmin downstairs had excellent curry.  The bars were also great as was the exec"
1807,"I stayed 7 nights here in Jan/Feb and I must admit this is the BEST HOTEL I have stayed at with excellent customer service.  The staff definitely goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy.  There are so many examples I can provide you with their level of service that the space wouldn't be enough to write.  After staying there for so long, I can almost consider them my friends.  First and foremost, I would especially like to praise Devi, the manager, she is fantastic.  A true example of customer service, you can be sure to contact her with anything and she will follow it through promptly and professionally.  I am glad I connected with her, absolutely admire work ethic and customer service experience.   Sachin and Sushil from the room service are the greatest people you can"
1808,"This hotel was excellent. I last stayed here 3 years ago and it was as good as I remember. Check-in staff were friendly and helpful. Room was absolutely fine, although slightly disappointing that we did not have a sea view. The pool area was clean and well-maintained. I had access to the Executive Lounge which was great and the staff there were particularly friendly and could not do enough to make my stay enjoyable."
1809,Excellent property to stay. It is on the expensive side. Rooms are spacious with all amenities available . Room service staff was excellent . The staff at the arrival were bit slow to respond . Very tip oriented service. Had to off load luggage myself before somebody came to help. Front desk staff were excellent . Breakfast was inclusive in the rate. Very well treated to buffet type breakfast with live hot food served. Good variety. The evening dinner too was good with lots of varriety. The service was good with Head Chef coming round to to check on quality of food and any special needs. My wife was not well as she had belly bug. They provided her with fruits and special dietary food as required. The transfer to the airport which was included was prompt and were looked after
1810,"One of the finest hotel in Mumbai rather I say in India. Had wonderful time, enjoyed all facilities given by them. Amazing view inside and outside of the hotel. Awesome food and excellent service. Hope to visit again."
1811,Hotel staff were great very attentive and helpful. Hotel room was good and well maintained. The restaurant food was good and offered a variety of choices to suit all tastes. A choice of three swimming areas and secure access to Juhu beach.
1812,"Been here with colleagues for annual conference meet. It was a memorable hospitality experience. Be it Staff at reception, housekeeping , room service or even valet parking. Very well managed and controlled. Room were nicely kept with facilities at a call. Nice juhu beach view from my 5th floor room. Buffet spread for all day food was nice. Overall a pleasure staying there."
1813,Sahar JW Marriott a newly constructed well spread hotel lives upto the name of it's brand. Entrance lobby is impressive by not only Mumbai but international standards . The concierge is elegant but well spread out and least cluttered. Breakfast area is usual.Rooms are big enough and bathrooms are stylishly planned as per current interior trends of opening of bathrooms to bed room here with sliding doors. Which I found inconvenient due to position of the tub. Otherwise bathroom is nice.  Room poolside should be better in comparison to backside.  I'm not adding a new point- rooms near lift is always convenient
1814,"Tell me - why do hotels shy away from giving two card keys when it is a couple that is checking in? Why should one have to ask for it?! This hotel went one further and said they would send it up to the room (which they never did, my husband went to reception and collected it).  We booked a room on points which clearly places one on the lowest rung of the food chain. I've never understood this concept as the only reason one got those points is because of loads of money already having been spent on multiple stays. Anyway. Freebie or not, the room was small, badly furnished, overcrowded and the most disastrous architectural segregation of bathroom and bedroom that I have seen. One had to slide two sliding doors to close the bathroom which practically encroached into the sleeping"
1815,"Luxury meets taste and excellence.Been on lunch and when ever I get near Juhu I try to get here, its amazing place to visit. Lot has been said about this place so just go there and enjoy food, service and ambiance."
1816,Very nice business hotel with the nicest view to the Juhu beach. The suite facing the beach and pool is one of the best in the world. The staff are very friendly. The break fast is very good. A nice hotel with the best view
1817,"My wife and myself have just completed yet another stay at the JW Marriott, Juhu, Mumbai.  Again, our stay was fantastic.  Fantastic views, great service, delicious food, superb massages, etc, etc, etc.  We would like to thank Akansha at guest relations for making us feel very welcome once again.  Then there was Priyesh at the Lounge....ever obliging.  Ivan was there for our last day and made it memorable :-)    At Saffron, arguably the best Nawabi restaurant in Bombay, we were looked after by Rahul, Rameez and the manager Vishal.  At Lotus Cafe, there was Rafi Ansari, Avinash and Beverley amongst several others who went out of their way to help us.  The Quan Spa is really, really good with well trained therapists from the North East and elsewhere.  Keep up the good work.    We"
1818,"Excellent location facing the beach , The best Ambient Restaurant  which i ever seen .  The Gym is well equipped . The only flip side is the beach can be seen only in a angle and you do not get a complete view of the Beach"
1819,Nice rooms. Good choice of restaurants. Lovely bars. Good for family and kids. Food is really good. The Sunday brunch was excellent. Close to the airport. Pick up was really good and prompt.  Stayed for three nights. Will stay again
1820,After a long tour in India we decided to treat ourselves to a couple of days lounging by a pool and enjoying Juhu Beach.  We even splashed out on an Executive room with a seaview. What a disappointment! The room was small and cramped and badly designed.  eg  You walked through the toilet (which has a glass door!) to get to the shower.  You could not sit to enjoy the 'sea view' because the real view from the window was of the grim opposite wing of the hotel;  if you wanted to see the sea you had to stand in one little corner and angle yourself to look out across what might otherwise have been a tiny balcony but was actually just a bed of stones covered in pigeon droppings.  Not pretty! Front desk service was seriously lacking. The executive lounge offered a nice range of snacks
1821,"JW Marriott stay - Saturday 10th Oct - Sunday 25th Oct 2015   We are writing to inform you of our wonderful stay at the JW Marriott. I was on a business trip and had asked my husband to accompany me.    Front office reception:   Deepika - From the minute we entered the hotel, the warmth of the hotel attracted us. The front office reception was very busy. We were happy to patiently wait and Deepika, the front office manager checked us in. She was extremely polite, professional and checked us in very smoothly giving us a very nice room for 15 nights / 16 days (room 235).    From that point onwards, every time Deepika met us during our stay she greeted us well, took timeout to talk to us and met all our queries where possible. Deepika also arranged for us to have breakfast one"
1822,One of my favorite properties in India  Rooms are well appointed   Breakfast Buffett is a culinary treat and the executive lounge has a gear view of the pool and beach  The service is top notch with all staff respectful and helpful   The beach is public and there is a security gate to get out to the beach.  Many peddlers and beggars so security is the watch word for tourists if you go on the beach  This is a favorite property of the Bollywood crowd so you may run into s movie star while visiting
1823,I checked in on 31 January at this hotel for a night stay. I was upgraded to a suite room having a ocean facing view. The checkin staff Mr. Gajendra was super fantastic and almost all hotel staff were very friendly and professional. The view from the room and the ambience was awesome. food at the 24/7 coffee shop was very good and have a delicious sea food menu. Thanks to Mr. Pranav at the restaurant who took good care of us. The overall stay was excellent and wow
1824,"It was my second visit with my family here,would like to say the food was amazing as usual and the staff were very helpful,chef Harpreet took special efforts to serve us with the best of what we wanted."
1825,"I stayed for a business trip. Room was very nice and with beach view. I really liked the room, its decoration, cleanliness and all the things provided in the room. Best thing about the hotel is its location and I could taste all the foody stuff at Juhu beach. Bfast was too good, quite supportive staff right from entry gate, front desk, lobby and restaurant. I truly enjoyed my stay and will like to recommend my friends and colleagues to have experience here."
1826,"Where do I start with. The front desk is avg but rest is superb. I stayed for 3 days and throughly enjoyed the stay. The landscaping is something to see, simply beautiful. The food spread is one of the widest I have experienced. smoked Salmon can not be missed the best. I had ever. The rooms are very comfortable. In the morning one can go to Juhu beach for jogging."
1827,"The feel is like a slice of a goa 5 star resort with access to juhu beach,  lobby, coffeeshop,  views from rooms and suites are awesome, great place,  special thanks to shambhavi and neha for making my Stay a memorable one."
1828,"I have stayed at this hotel so many times and it never ceases to impress me. It is probably my favourite hotel in the world.   The rooms are beautiful, a touch small but this is Mumbai! The facilities are outstanding. The main pool is a really beautiful ancient looking large pool with seating areas inside and around the pool. There is also the amazing children's shallow pool with a water slide which really made our family holiday. The kids could play there for hours and we were happy knowing they were safe and could play there with only our supervision - whilst we got foot massages pool side sipping fresh coconuts!!!  The food at this hotel is the best I have ever eaten (I am not Indian myself btw!). Be prepared to gain some serious weight! The buffet in the morning is amazing."
1829,"Overall amazing experience it was. I went there with my best friends and it was a memorable stay for me. Swimming pool was very clean and tidy, Service given by hotel was quite quick, the sea view from the hotel is the cherry on cake. I will never forget my stay at JW Marriott. Best place for couples. Must try."
1830,Good place for a mid night meal. We ordered the regular butter chicken and paneer tikka masala and tomato soup. Good service and very tasty meal. A nice place to chill over some nice gossip and good chat and to top it all some nice delicious food. All in all a good place to visit
1831,"Great location right on the Juhu beach which has been totally cleaned up since I was here 5 Yrs ago. Although a little small but still the a great room, service and best breakfast on my 20 days trip so far. Chef Dvipal Mehta personally greeted all the patrons to make sure all was well.. Nice touch!"
1832,"I saw this hotel being built many years ago and our family has stayed there very frequently and written several reviews of the hotel over the years. A few years ago, I even visited with the GM, who was brought on by the local owners as they replaced Marriott International Management. Fortunately they have staff who have stayed at the hotel such as Executive Assistant Ami Panchal who has always been my go to person to ensure everything is set up for our stay, including room, transportation etc.  Staying around New Year's is always very hectic for the hotel and patience is something you learn as its generally the time we stay.   The Buffets and the Executive Lounge are again awesome, and while the lines for the breakfast may seem long, move very fast. Once seated, a tip...leave"
1833,Lovely location and great food but absence of night club is felt. The service delivered as promised. The sea view is amazing and staffs are professionals. I loved the way security guards welcome and gym is awesome
1834,"We stayed just after Christmas and celebrated New years at the hotel.  There were 3 rooms booked altogether which were 2 deluxe and 1 Premier Club.  The hotel was exceptionally busy and fully booked so the price was at the top end of the range.  You cannot help but notice the grandeur and luxury as you enter the hotel with its vast lobby area and sweeping staircase to the lower level.  Check in was easy enough and straightforward and Saif was good enough to organise our rooms on the same level.  The sea view is ok but not worth it in my opinion unless you plan to spend a lot of time in your room perhaps. Positives: The Premier Club was a good size and came with coffee pod machine, bath and shower which was handy with 2 young children. Breakfast is plentiful and there is an"
1835,The Lotus Cafe has a wonderful display of food & service...there's a wide variety..the choice of Indian food to a good old fashioned omelette...fruit and many pastries and specialty juices..thanks to Rajendra for always having the perfect cup of hot chai tea ready for me when i arrive
1836,"Our stay at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu was an absolute pleasure. The rooms, restaurants, and all facilities were exceptionally spotless and always inviting. The breakfast/brunch buffet was something I have never experienced! The buffet offered everything you could imagine and was very fresh! I think what sets the JW Marriott apart from the rest is the unbelievably accommodating, friendly staff! The Head Concierge, Noel Sumitra, hands down provided the most exceptional, attentive, and true customer service I have ever experienced. His professionalism, stoic demeanor, and genuine care for those staying at the JW Marriott is unmatched. He went above and beyond for me in every way when I found myself in a very stressful situation concerning a lost item and without his attentiveness"
1837,"I stayed three nights here and paid for two rooms, single occupancy. Far too pricey for a regular traveller in my opinion. All facilities are good quality. I had an ocean view room but most of them are at a 45 degree angle to the sea looking on to inner courtyard.  Having come from two weeks in rural India it was nice to have running hot water and some comfort but price differential is too much from ¬£10 a night to over ¬£120 per night. There has to be a better option."
1838,"We booked an Exec Room with a sea view. Room was very good and the view excellent. Transfers from the Airport very efficient. service however was 'spotty'.......our experience of Exec lounges is that they are Oases of calm away from the hustle bustle of the main hotel activities......this one in the evenings was like a downmarket Pub...noisy and generally pretty ordinary . Providing free booze for four hours each a evening might have something to do with it! usually there is a two hour complimentary session or indeed complimentary food and an honesty bar!  Would we stay again ,yes probably for the location on the beach and the proximity to the airport.     Would want to add that the quality and sophistication of the service in the Italian and Indian restaurants in the hotels was"
1839,"One walks into the lobby and you have a picture of the Arabian Sea framed for you. The hotel feels like a resort with multiple swimming pools ,you must go to the saltwater pool the water is therapeutic and this pool is a nice quiet part of the poolside. The offering in the restaurants is great and the must try restaurant is Saffron . The rooms are a bit small however the view compensates for it all . Try and reserved the premier rooms if you would like a bathtub as the regular rooms have only a shower. Service is warm and hospitable it's a lovely weekend getaway . Lots to do they have a nice Spa as well and a kids room where you can leave the children."
1840,"I booked Executive Ocean front room. Pictures on JW Marriott Juhu webpage is misleading. None of the Ocean front rooms have ocean view. Hotel built in such a way you get side view from all Ocean front rooms except top the line Suite. You have to stand close to the side of the window to get Ocean view. Room service poor. I had to wait for 30 mins to get room access card delivered to my room. Hotel has constructed too many rooms that makes only restaurant very busy. At busy time you might have to wait in a queue to secure a table for breakfast. Nothing 5 star about breakfast. However courteous, nice restaurant staff. But Restaurant located in a big hall made you feel you are at central railway station. nothing cosy about this place. Hotel offers nothing else. Small open bar, no"
1841,do you like to pamper then stay here.. you will be happy to see the finest attention to detail done...for the staff to food all in PERFECT!! Comfort of connectivity makes it even better.. not to far from airport..
1842,"This hotel has the friendliest customer service staff I have ever seen.  Akhansha Sen who is the manager is outstanding and should be given an award for the most customer friendly manager ever. She was extremely patient in answering all my questions, confirming my reservation and also helping me with conference rooms.  Thank you Akansha and I look forward to meeting you."
1843,"Stayed there for 3 nights.  I wouldnt expect less from a JW Marriott property-good location, nice rooms and good service at the hotel.   Used the spa facility, gym and pool.  Lovely spa facility.  Excellent gym- clean and a lot of equipment/ options.  Rooms were serviced wonderfully.  Was able to get checked in quickly.  Went to spices for a meal-it was awful. We had arrived from an international flight so we were pretty jet-lagged and just needing a decent meal.  I wasn't expecting anything fancy - but despite the restaurant being fairly empty-it took us over 20 minutes to get a table.  Service was horrible, food was cold, and cocktails were awful.  We did say something to the waiter and he had a blank look on his face.  So def go for the beautiful property but skip the meals."
1844,"I stayed at the J.W. Marriott at Juhu beach in Mumbai for 2 nights, for a business trip.  We had all-day meetings in a conference room, with buffet lunches and dinners, so we didn't get to experience the rest of the hotel much.  But it was very comfortable overall.  The room was large enough, and had wifi (free if you sign up for Marriott Rewards) although the bandwidth left a lot to be desired.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  The food was fine, although after three days it got repetitive.  The breakfast menu was also quite similar on all three days.  The location is great, right on the beach."
1845,The service is exceptional. Rajendra and Vikram are fantastic!!!  Your drinks are never empty and whatever you desire is always brought.   They never say NO!  Plus they are always smiling.   The staff at the Lotus Cafe and in particular Rajendra and Vikram are the best in the industry!!  Thank you JW Marriott Juhu Mumbai
1846,"The rooms are very nice, property is well maintained and is in excellent condition. The service is bit slow and need some improvement. The place where breakfast is served has acoustic issues and is very loud. The service at breakfast is also slow and you have to remind the staff. Overall excellent place to stay."
1847,How can I start? It was more than my expectation. I never think that I will go there anytime. I was surprised to see that hotel. I cannt explain its beauty. I know that was my 1st and last visit to this gorgeous hotel but those few minute I will always remember in my life.
1848,"I could not write more about this Mariott property in the Juhu area of Mumbai, because you will have to experience the stay yourself. It gives you a sense of pride staying here, not only because of it's grandness and luxury but the hospitality as well.   We stayed there for one night and booked an ocean view room and it was nice, cosy and well up to our expectations. The breakfast is the best you can have with a spread across cuisines/tastes. Have ample time for your breakfast if you want to truly enjoy and have a sense of their spread.  I would strongly recommend this for business as well as family holidays. Book an ocean view room and you will have an experience you would not forget!  Kudos Mariott Team!  Regards,  kG"
1849,"The hotel is great! The breakfast buffet has a good variety.  It is very close to the hotel, and I also liked that it was close to Linking Road for shopping purposes.  Other than that, I didn't find that the Juhu beach area had much to do as a tourist."
1850,I was upgraded to suite level with beautiful ocean view. Hotel staff was very friendly. Restaurants and bars are very nice. Mobile checkin was breeze and was welcomed right at gate. I would recommend this hotel. Only regret this was business trip and not vacation.
1851,"Visited for one night before long haul flight. Close-ish to the airport but traffic made it fairly slow both directions.  The hotel is vast. We got accidentally upgraded due to sharing the same name as another guest! We did have an airport transfer included as part of the upgrade which was subsequently cancelled!  Nice spa area. We had a couple of treatments and relaxed in the steam room.  Pool area outside is ok. A LOT of pigeons across the outside of the hotel and grounds which is maybe difficult to control - it smelled kind of bad. You can also go right out onto the beach for a look. It's mostly locals, school kids etc wandering up and down, playing etc.   Breakfast selection was overwhelming. Huge variety of Indian and western style breakfast. All very good quality and great"
1852,"I visited the restaurant of this hotel. Its near international airport Andheri. The range and variety of food is amazing. Best I liked is live chat counter, good, hygienic chat to eat. You can make your own soup, vegetables, fish dishes... Today they had some special occasion for kids. Some games, fun for free.."
1853,"It was hard to choose between a 4 or 5 star rating on tripadvisor but at the end I have chosen to give 4 stars.  The hotel is hudge and has several restaurants and bars so always possible to find the perfect place for your mood. The staff is very friendly (sometimes to friendly :-) ) and they would really do everyting to make your stay even more enjoyable.  Upon arrival we didn't get any explanatioin about the facilities of the hotel. It's strange that reception staff never mentionned the spanish bar, the other restaurants, ...so in general there is no upselling done in the hotel and that is a loss of revenue. Another example is that the minibar is not refilled with drinks. The main reason why I gave 4 stars are for the noisy doors. At night I woke up several times (and my"
1854,"Located in Juhu right on Juhu beach- one of the older 5 star properties in Mumbai. Has maintained its 5 start status with aplomb. Rooms are still very fresh, large in size, all rooms with a sea view, spacious bathrooms. All staff seem to be well trained- check-in was a breeze, housekeeping staff extremely courteous. Breakfast spread decent. Will certainly stay here again."
1855,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in November and was pleasantly surprised by the service I received on entering the hotel. The rooms were nice and the lobby and restaurant are very grand. I would recommend the breakfast buffet - they have a variety of chefs who cook the breakfast in front of you.  One thing that frustrated me was when i asked the hotel to order me a taxi, they convinced me to pay for a private driver which was way over priced and the driver proceeded to take me to all his friends shops to look at rugs and carved elephants - I was really annoyed by the end of this!  I also feel that the wifi should be free in a hotel like this."
1856,I stayed in JW Marriott for 3 days. Exceptionally maintained and some rooms are beach facing..Room service and food is excellent.. The best advantage is location as one can  easily go for morning walk at Juhu beach.. Another advantage for visitors coming from outside is that one can see and meet lot of Bollywood personalities as I met with Bollywood Sultan Salman khan shooting along with some other stars also. Good hotel to spend quality  time at Mumbai.
1857,"We visited this property just after Diwali ,, Check in took 20 mins due to huge rush, Room size ok , Bed perfect, All  Tv Channels available, Pool side was alright. In our room package Wine bottle was complimentary,, had to remind them 3 times finally the wine arrives, giving excuses as majority staff are on leave.  Dinner  & Breakfast was awesome. Over all a Good experience."
1858,"I have been staying here for the past 14 years.  Never disappoints, always great service, great rooms.  The staff are all willing to go the extra mile to ensure your comfort.  Outstanding.  I would recommend a visit for business or pleasure."
1859,"I was here for 2 nights from January 1-3, 2016. I was extremely lucky to get a room here as I had not booked and friends of mine used a contact to get me in (my previous hotel turned out to be appalling, so I had to leave immediately).  This is, of course and outstanding hotel, and lives up to the JW Marriott hype. I was in a small and overpriced room, but was so grateful to be there after the traumatic time I'd had earlier in the day with my previous booking. Clean premises, efficient  staff in all areas of the complex."
1860,"i had good time at the hotel. You are met with the most grand entrance to the hotel and on entering reception, you can see right out to the pool and the horizon. Make sure you are here for sunset - it is an awesome sight!!!  The standard of cleanliness throughout the hotel was amazing - I have never before seen men in the swimming pool cleaning every inch of the pool, including the decorative rocks.   On the subject of the pool, again another amazing part of the hotel. It is an infinity pool so you feel that you are swimming out to the sunset!!!  I love this place and would go again. Noel, the head Concierge was extremely helpful and made my stay memorable.   I would highly recommend this hotel.   I would also like to comment on the great  live classical music being played at"
1861,"Great location. Overlooking the sea with direct access to the beach-- this section of the beach is much neater and quieter.  Rooms lavishly done. The marble in the toilets give a rich feeling. Good pool with a separate kids pool with water slides, where my daughter had lot of fun. Free wifi. Good view from the room of the sea and pool.  Friendly staff. ready to help. Lavish breakfast @Lotus cafe. good choice of multiple restaurants for fine dining within hotel. Many more choices nearby too  Take rooms away from Lift  for better sea and pool view  What can be better:  Toilet does not have a spray. We Indians prefer to use water spray and toilet paper. Which is more hygienic.  No bath tub.  Bathroom door had no locks. we were a big family with 3 rooms with kids moving from room to"
1862,"The hotel did not meet my expectations for a JW, but may still be one of the best options in the city. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is right at Juhu Beach, however do not expect to relax on a nice, safe and clean beach. It is far from it. There are two locked gates to access the beach, with security check in and out, which was a little scary (wonder why...). There are hundreds of pigeons all over the place, which was also not pleasant. There is a business lounge, which is always nice and the main restaurant has many options of local and international food."
1863,"Stayed with family in December 2015. One elderly family member had a serious accident on premises which resulted in having to be flown home and hospitalised for over 2 weeks. Level of support and help was distant, uncoordinated and pretty pathetic and we were then overcharged on departure.   Real shame as a lovely location and really helpful staff at lower management level but total ""head in sand"" response when I would have expected them to pull out all the stops to help and provide support when a customer has a serious accident on hotel premises.   Was  surprised to be charged for fax services to my insurance provider when arranging repatriation back home and also being charged for meals when due to level of injuries unable to move out of hotel.    Very disappointing as had"
1864,"Had planned a weekend Mumbai date with my wife.. and our first stay was at the JW... growing up in Mumbai, I was always fascinated with the entrance of this hotel. It just looked so stylish!  It all begins there and ends there though. The common areas, lobby, etc. are really well done and are very inviting. A true 5 star feeling. Our room on the other hand was just OK. Nothing amazing about it at all. I had high expectations from JW and they definitely disappointed us. The pool area is pretty good too!  Location is obviously a definite plus point if one has to truly enjoy the Juhu Beach experience. But after staying in half a dozen properties in Mumbai, I wasn't impressed with JW at all.  The breakfast was pretty good and while it's complimentary for guests, one can purchase"
1865,"We were initially disappointed by the lack of a balcony and the ocean view not quite what we expected but frankly as our stay went on over 6 nights we were more and more impressed by the hospitality and service offered. The New Year's Eve food spread was just unbelievably good, both quality and variety. I was concerned how much must have been wasted but no effort was spared to please."
1866,Absolutely the most amazing service and the staff were so helpful every time i needed anything. They were a rare breed of perfectionist and loved my stay in the hotel.  Definitely the place to stay and the inhouse dining was so good too.   My daughter and me loved our time there.  Thanks
1867,"had stayed in this hotel for few hours , that also due to some urgency of work , would never have stayed otherwise . and they charged me with 2 nights . the view shown in the website of the hotel is a myth ."
1868,Stayed for a couple of nights on a business trip. Not too far from the airport. Good room with a sea view. The buffet breakfast had a lavish spread as you would expect. Pay a premium for your Wi Fi. Speeds can be dodgy . Expect to see a few actors from the Hindi film industry with their big entourage.
1869,"On any given day I would like to stay here again. I stayed there for 10 days and became huge fan of their hospitality. Each and every staff member was polite, courteous, smiling and helpful. Especially the staff at lotus cafe. Breakfast spread was one of the best I've seen.  Property was also very good. Facilties like gym, Jacuzzi, swimming pool were very well maintained."
1870,I really felt like I was staying at a lavish palace during my stay here. The rooms were exquisite and the bed was probably one of the most comfortable ones I have slept on during any hotel stay. Really liked the food at the coffee shop and the swimming pool is breathtaking! This is pure luxury..also got a chance to see a lot of movie stars and celebrities who frequent the hotel
1871,"We had a meeting there.... first week of December, they hv huge conference hall for 100 to 200 people. Overall experience was good. Near to domestic airport around 20 mints way by cab. Hotel services was perfect. It is nice place to stay if you want to enjoy juhu chopati n all."
1872,I have been coming to this hotel last 5/7 years very disappointed this tripe the service is going down like 3Star I used to like this hotel very much but now will think before booking I know it is holidays season but I have been in this many time.they need to change or they will loose revenue
1873,It was a brilliant Business Hotel located near the Juhu beach. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Overall experience was superb. Brilliant place to stay. You might even be lucky to meet a celebrity or two here.
1874,It was my 1 day hop to mumbai with family. Location wise this was perfect very near to Juhu beach and linking road with lots of shopping option.  View of the beach from the room was pretty nice.  Easy access to the beach from swimming pool side.  best thing ... Breakfast.  Only glitch some cleaning issue at arrival.  Overall a great stay..
1875,"I stayed at the hotel due to its proximity to the international and domestic airport  - I arrived at the international airport and was promptly collected by a hotel car. At the check in I was asked if I wanted to upgrade so that I could use the executive club lounge which I did. That was the mistake. The staff in the lounge are at the best inattentive and not like the staff in the rest of the hotel. The food and beverage in the exec lounge is sparse and not at all at par with exec lounges in other 5 star hotels. On my second at the hotel, I asked for tea at the lounge. I was promptly brought a mixed tea and milk concoction which I did not ask for and was informed by the water that he had taken the liberty of mixing the tea before he served it to me! The rest of the hotel was"
1876,We were visiting Mumbai and at this hotel for 3 nights. We will definitely be back. The staff and service is completely amazing. They will accommodate any request. The food at the restaurants wad equally good. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The pool area is very large and spread out. The hotel sits on the beach at Juhu Beach.
1877,"I'll keep it simple; Quality as you'd expect from Marriott with the passion of India. Great location, amenities and food. Bombay bakerie in reception is fantastic. The pool is luxurious and the service can't be beaten. The spa is also worth visiting although very pricey given the competition in the area.  Speak to concierge for things to do in the area if you're stuck and check out the Sunday brunch in the main restaurant!"
1878,Marriott Juhu is a superb hotel situated  a little far from the beach. Rooms have a little to be desired . The deluxe room has something to be desired a bit basic small anything but deluxe. The staff are always helpful trying to make your stay a pleasant one . They try to make up what the hotel lacks in accommodation .The breakfast is something to be savoured. Other restaurants are also good . Score 6 out of 10
1879,Have been coming here for past 11 years. Spent my 40th here. Have been fortunate to stay in the executive lounge. It is a tad expensive but we've loved it here. That's not to say that we haven't had any problems in our 8 stays here but they did make up for it.  Great service. Taken friends there as well.  Food canbe improved. Used to go Mezzo Mezzo every time but last 2 times a bit lacking.  Thanks Marriott.  Made some really good friends for life after meeting in the Executive lounge.
1880,"I am staying in the hotel now and will leave tomorrow. Checked in with very high expectations but little disappointed from today's breakfast. May be a small thing but wanted to share, Today while having my breakfast (table 31 at 8:15 am), I ordered egg Benedict(hotels signature dish). They said it will take 15 mins, I said I will wait, after 20 mins I followed up and being told that I will get you the status in 2 mins. No updates for 10 mins and when I again followed up they said he started to cook it. It really spoiled my entire experience of goodness in other things. Since breakfast is the first meal of your day and will be carrying this experience the whole day, it was not a good start.   No comments on hotel room and amenities as I am getting standard facilities what I"
1881,This was my fourth visit to this Hotel and i am pleased to say the have kept up the standard it is one of the top places to stay. Looks like the beach has been cleaned up slightly since my last visit although it is still jam packed at the weekends. I will always come back and stay here great service
1882,JW Marriott hotel is located at Juhu Beach area in Mumbai. The architecture & security point of view is superb in this hotel. The wow factor of this hotel is SEA side overview directly from the hotel area.
1883,One of the best Hotels that I have visited better than some of the hotels in Dubai.  If I could I would base myself here all year round  Keep up the good work Marriot  Close to Bhandra for shopping and to the beach for your morning jog. Excellent location for traveling to and from the airport. I wouldn't book any other hotel in Mumbai also the transfer to and from the airport is faultless
1884,Just checked into room 269. Akshay at the reception was not very forthcoming and receptive to our needs. Stuck in a very unplesant room and waiting for Vini to give us a solution. Hope the rest of the holiday goes well. The sweet memories at JW have vanished as of now.
1885,"Hotel offers a car transportation service to/from airport, this is well worth it for hassle-free transport. The main entrance is opulent and well presented, clean. Friendly staff at reception and in all the restaurants. Rooms are well appointed. My room attended made me an elephant-shape out of a towel, everybody takes pride in their work. The buffet breakfast has a good selection of food, at dinner I was a little disappointed with the Italian restaurant (it was ok, nothing special), but the Saffron restaurant and the Tasting Menus - truly amazing, do not miss this opportunity, and such value for money. Outside space to the pool, seating area and onto beach are all well maintained."
1886,"Great place to chill for a relaxing weekend. an amazing place, close to restaurants nearby . a great breakfast with very good service at the Lotus caf√©. The sraff here are very attentive and efficient compared to those at the reception who are stiff ! but a great pool and on the beach so great to rejuvenate"
1887,"Stayed here for a couple of nights on a B&B basis.  The hotel is itself is pretty huge with great rooms, gardens and 3 swimming pools. You can access Juhu beach directly from the hotel as well and easily walk over to the chowpatty area as well as access several food cafes on Juhu Tara road itself. Service and cleanliness was impeccable. The rooms were spacious and well decorated with views of the beach and sea.  There are two things to be warned off though: Nov and Dec is wedding season so the hotel gets very busy (although this did not really impact the quality of service); secondly there is a distinct smell of sewage by the pool area (not sure if this is from the hotel or emanates from outside)."
1888,I checked in around 10 o clock in night .. My room nos was 268 .. I off the cooling system and went for meeting at lobby .. After 1 hour When I came back room was heavily smelled with paint and chemical odour.. I called 2 times to reception but no proper response.. Then I went to reception the waited me 20 min ... They are irresponsible people.. Don't go there
1889,"The hotel is very close to Airport and right next to the famous Juhu Beach. In fact the property has a private section of the beach making you feel away from the rush, hustle and bustle of Mumbai. Very spacious property in general with great rooms. Food is great, one of the best I've had in some time. One of the best luxury hotels in area. Would definitely want to come back in future. Ask for sea facing room (just an advice ;-) )"
1890,"This time we stayed for 11 nights. The service is perfect, we really enjoyed the service given by Saif of the front desk. The rooms are perfect and house keeping was excellent. We had a few times a bite in the coffee shop and twice dinner in the Lotus Cafe. Both places serve good food. We asvise however Management to lower the sound level of the music in the coffee shop. Sometimes you can hardly hear each other which increases the noise level again because everybody starts shouting. This was the third time we stayed here and next time in Mumbai we will stay here again."
1891,"About 15 minutes from the airport and on the beach make sense you feel you are aware from the rush of Mumbai. Very spacious quality hotel, good service and very comfortable. The pool is huge and ideal. Definitely an establishment I will be coming back to in the future."
1892,"I generally tend to like Indian hotels, because i get much better service, and chaps tend to be a little more anticipating of my needs (perhaps because i have been in india for awhile now)... but must say had a bit of a disappointing stay...  The strengths: The lobby looks superb-massive and imposing, and the open areas are very well done, there is a back door directly leading  to the Juhu beach, and the decor is very nice- old world wooden dominated- this hotel has amongst the best gyms i have been to, and a good swimming pool in which you can swim real lengths... And the business centre is really nice...   However:  1- they refused to allow a late checkout- i havent come across that one before.. typically, most hotels do give a 2pm deadline, but these folks not only made sure"
1893,"We stayed for 3 notes at JW Marriott although our preferred hotel is Taj Lands end in Bandra as it is more centrally located for visiting South Mumbai. JWM has very good service the staff are courteous and quick to respond. We had angled sea views from our ""deluxe"" room which was adequately sized with a good desk and lots of power outlets. The bathrooms are compact but redone and good. The breakfast spread is excellent and has more offerings than other hotels. The staff were willing to accommodate special requests. The Executive Lounge on the 4th floor is a good place to relax and get a coffee or a bite to eat. Happy hour drinks was surprisingly good selection of wines although only Johnny Walker Red Label for scotch drinkers  All in all a good value and comfortable stay. But"
1894,It's one of the most luxurious hotel in India. It has a spectacular view of sea kissing the pool of the hotel. The food area is very spacious and the food here is mouth watering. The rooms are spacious and at night the hotel sparkles like a solitaire diamond in the ring. It's a landmark of Juhu Mumbai.
1895,"On arrival, they had upgraded us to a room with executive ocean view. The room was spacious and well furnished. The beds and beddings were also perfectly done as instructed. The room also included complimentary breakfast at Lotus Caf√© for two people. The spread for the breakfast was quite detailed and had multiple cuisine options."
1896,We were here for 2 nights in early Nov . Rooms were well allocated and was having beach view. breakfast was not as good as I have heard about it. Stay was confirtable and staff was very courteous and friendly .
1897,We have stayed at this hotel on a number of occassions in the past and have good memories but it was only an average stay this time.  Our experiance this time at check in was average and the welcome was very lukewarm by front office staff.   The lobby is over crowded and loses its shine of a 5 star hotel. There is no personal service anymore.  The breakfast and dinner was of average quality and struggling service level. We had to wait for everything beyond reasonable time.  The room is very small for a 5 star hotel and the price they charge you for it.  Not very impressed by the staff and dated rooms. May be it is time to look for another hotel in Mumbai.
1898,"Whenever we visit Mumbai, we make sure we always pay a visit to JW Marriott in Juhu. We have never had a bad experience in this hotel, the only thing we can say that spoils the pleasure of spending time here, is the smell from Juhu fish market by the beach. The grounds, pool area, spa and restaurant are always well kept and the service has always been exceptional. We have visited twice now for the day, rather than an overnight stay. and the spa experience was definitely the best in this city I'd had."
1899,We had one free night stay and we got it upgraded to a sea facing room at extra cost. We arrived at 12 noon and immediately we were given our room on top floor with club lounge facility. Thanks Shabaz. The room was of decent size with excellent sea view. There are 5/6 restaurants and Bombay Baking for quick meals and coffee. The gym was big and open 24 hours. The club lounge was excellent for complimentary breakfast and drinks in the evening. Priyesh took great care of us in the lounge. Worth staying.
1900,Went for a coffee. Nice chilled coffee. Pleasant ambience. Nice smooth music playing around. Would love to visit again.slightly on costlier side. But u can expect this from a renowned five star hotel. Must visit
1901,"From pick up at the airport to check in excellent service.  Our room wasn't ready as we arrived at 11 am so they allowed us to wait in the club lounge. We stayed on the 4th level with a view of mumbai rather than the beach which was fine.  The rooms are a little small but we had a rollaway and still managed. Housekeeping was done daily by Paras who was excellent. The little touches such as fresh lillies, fruit and extra towels made it perfect.   If you order anything from room service it is prompt. The facilities like steam room and sauna are world class. Really relaxing. Gym is 24 hours and an excellent facility.  Breakfast was fantastic.  Fabulous selection and excellent service.  Highly recommend staying here it is welcome relief after the oppressing heat, smog and crowds of"
1902,I stayed at this hotel for a 4 week business trip and couldn't have been happier with the accommodations.  As a Marriott gold member they provided access to the executive lounge which was a wonderful place to get made to order omelets and try an Indian breakfast. The late night attendant knew I got off work too late for the evening service so he saved macaroons and cookies for me every night.  He was a very nice man who provided conversation at the end of the workday.  They also upgraded me to a room with a wonderful view of the Arabian sea. My work hours necessitated returning to the hotel after midnight during the week so I had the majority of my meals in my room.  The in room dining was always delivered with a smile and the large menu provide variety for extended stay. Make
1903,A brilliant service from arriving to leaving. I was given a free upgrade on arrival which was a welcome surprise. Plenty of good choice with 5 restaurants and a buffet style restaurant offering food from around the world. The hotel is right next to the beach and it's nice to go for a stroll in the morning
1904,"I've had the privilege of staying at this hotel for an extended period and I cannot fault the hospitality, efficiency and pure friendliness of the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and they succeed in making the whole experience very positive. Breakfast is a delight; quality food, so much variety and chefs prepared to cook to preference. The Exec Lounge is like being at home but better in many respects! The staff are relaxed but professional and make the effort to get to know their guests personally. The hotel is situated by the beach so the view from most of the rooms is great - the well designed gardens, beautiful pools and often an amazing sunset!"
1905,"One of the best experiences I've had at a hotel. We stayed at the hotel for 8 days. I was accompanying my other half while he was on a work trip. We were blown away by the service. We got the sea view from our room. It was great! The staff at the concierge lounge were very courteous and very helpful. Special thanks goes out to Sufiyaan, Wasim, Rohit and one more name I'm forgetting (Pradeep?). The location was perfect. Right next to the beach and not far away from the shopping areas."
1906,"Stayed here for a night on my way to Goa. The hotel is not bad, our partial sea view room was ok. It would have been better if the dirty construction site was not between our room and the sea view.  The food from the a la carte menu was awful. I ordered a garlic ban with some lamb/meat curry, my partner ordered some chicken tikka type thing. Both were left practically untouched. Breakfast was ok and the chef came to discuss the awful food from the previous day which indicates that they care a little. The cafe was good. I enjoyed the cake from there.  The pool is tiny and the beach is a no go area. Very filthy. We walked onto the beach through a huge guarded metal door which was locked behind us. Clearly a sign of the times. I felt like I was having a nightmare walking from a"
1907,"Great Hotel, Exceptional service.  Right before I started my journey i got an email from the Hotel in case I needed anything,  I replied that I needed early check in and they responded that they would try.  I land at the airport and a BMW 7 series car is waiting to pick me up with Wifi in the car.  Early check in a Jiffy at the Hotel. Exceptional service at the reception (The lady keeps on thanking me for being a silver member).  The Hotel staff is very good (Never seen such staff around the world and I travel to all cities in the world)."
1908,I visited JW Marriott five years back for dinner and was highly impressed by its grandure. This time I am here for my anniversary and before coming I told my wife about the grandure of the hotel. But our experiance right at check in was average and the welcome was very lukewarm by front office staff. Also the shine of the porch and lobbly which was five years back is lost.  The lunch at coffee shop was also having below average service level. We had to wait for everything beyond reasonable time.   However the view of Juhu beach from room is amazing. The room is good and well made. Overall average experiance this time.
1909,I have had an amazing experience in this hotel... It is royal and the rooms are also very nice. Staff was very helpful and infrastructure was just fantastic! luxurious stay at the JW Marriott made me overjoyed!
1910,"During my maiden visit to Mumbai, one of the best memories made were by visiting this iconic landmark in Juhu area of Mumbai. Though we didn‚Äôt stay there as we had alternate stay arrangements but we visited this place for dine out and experienced the basking glory of this Hotel.   This Hotel is perfect paradigm of Luxury and opulence. The palace kind building reminds of the era of Mughals and you feel like a King there. The hospitality and service that they showers on you is exemplary. All the facilities and hospitality provided by well mannered and Welcoming staff of Hotel makes you feel and comprehend the actual meaning of care and luxury.  The hotel has 5 Restaurants. Lobby is huge and interior decoration is simply mind blowing. Dine out area is in basement and inside the"
1911,"We have been visiting the hotel and its club and midnight buffet ever since it opened. The night club is closed, and they no longer have the midnight buffet. A chance night to spend in Mumbai and we were debating between lands end and marriott. In the end all those dreamy nights spent near the pool looking at the flame burning outside got the best of us (for which you need to be staying in the hotel now as they have blocked entry) and we booked a nights stay under a wonderful offer of breakfast/dinner included. Its a lovely property and still retains a lot of its charm, but I think the decor and interior needs a makeover soon! But its in no way shabby. The staff are the real gems of this place with Jigar at check-in, Sachin and Ravi at Lotus and Rohan the chef absolutely"
1912,"An oasis in bustling Mumbai. Fantastic service from the excellent concierge Noel, to Samantha at the front desk and Sagar in the Lotus Cafe. Abundant breakfast buffet and comfortable rooms. Very nice stay!"
1913,"Very good exp and awesome exp.. You must visit mumbai and stat in Jw marriot , food was good, rooms was good ... Staff is good ...nice sight scene ... 3days stay was good and willing to vist again..verity of food sbd awsone buffet with virity of food.. And dinner as well very good"
1914,"Popped by here for a meal at around 5pm as it is almost impossible to find a meal at a sit down restaurant between 3 and 7 in Mumbai as most restaurants are closed during this time. Beautiful hotel set on Juhu beach. Although it is situated on Juhu Beach, there is no beach attached to the hotel. The poolside is fenced off outside, and the public beach starts. Pretty outdoor area to sit in during sunset. We had a delicious meal at the lobby restaurant that overlooks the outdoor pond. It was quite crowded from 4:30 to 6pm with people eating meals during this time."
1915,"Stayed for about 15 days and I can vouch for the hotel,service and hospitality.The food was delicious and the buffet was a real extravaganza. Near the beach having good elephant idols on the pool give a real treat to sore eyes. Cafe also is a place where you will relish the food served with a smile."
1916,Good hotel close to beach and airport. But not that convenient for Mumbai sight seeing. We had Juhu Suite which was awesome. Also had access to Executive Lounge - really good. Rated 5tar but more 4 star.
1917,"This is a great hotel for families. Friendly staff, great location, nice restaurants. Beach access. Will stay again when visiting the area. The cafe staff was super friendly. They even gave my kids a parting gift."
1918,"We have just returned from the JW Marriot, Mumbai Juhu, and our stay was absolutely amazing!  The staff are first-class and they can't do enough to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  It is in an ideal location and perfect for business or pleasure.  The food is outstanding, the amenities are superb and our whole experience was very special!  I highly recommend this hotel and guarantee that you wont be disappointed!"
1919,"Hotel location is not too far from the airport. With peak time Mumbai mayhem it is maximum 40 minutes away and most places are easily accessible from there. The hotel room was clean, tidy and the WIFI worked well. All the staff we encountered were welcoming, polite and extremely helpful. The food available for breakfast and dinner in the buffet is of an extremely high quality and more than enough choice to tuck in to. The pool was ok but I was very disappointed that there were licensing restrictions outside so no alcohol was allowed. Overall a great hotel with excellent faculties and attentive staff. Would stay here again when back in Mumbai."
1920,"Travelled to Juhu on business. Excellent, luxury hotel up to JW Marriott high standards. Check in was reasonably fast and efficient and I was quickly up to my room.  The room was lovely and while my room was not oceanfront, it had a nice view of both the courtyard garden area and a limited ocean view. The bathroom had large sliding doors which enabled it to be open to the bedroom area.  Kind of unique.  Cleanliness and maid service up to excellent Marriott standards.  Bottled water left in the room each day. The common areas are lovely with a large grand staircase leading down to the restaurant downstairs. I used a hotel car service to get to the airport and the driver was very professional.   Overall, excellent hotel in Juhu."
1921,there is only one word i have to say is just great and great  nothing more to it me and my business parners were there and people were very helpfull to get me what we need for our meetings and that to for free  no charges for print out and restaurant team was so nice to get us the coffee at any given point of time with complimentory french fries...  cheers to the team.
1922,"Love the food and presentation at the restaurant, it was awesome food, however service was kind of slow. When it comes to food it was value for money. My customer took me out for dinner. Recommended for food not for service."
1923,I had stayed multiple times at this lovely property. It has direct access to Juhu Beach which makes it even a better choice. The breakfast buffet is huge with great selection of foods. Only challenge is the location of this property because of havoc traffic jams that happens every evening in it's way.
1924,Had a very stay experience at this wonderful property manager by the Marriot Group. I and my wife visited for a weekend break at this hotel and enjoyed every bit of it. The swimming pool was amazing with the backdrop of the sea and sunset in the evening. The rooms were very nice and well kept. The food at the restaurant was also very good.
1925,I love this propert especially the pool side and the Bombay Baking Co .Usually do my work meetings here and chill with family in the club area.Have the most fond memories with my family at this hotel.Will always remain special :)
1926,"I had an amazing stay at the hotel during first 3 weeks of October. There was an initial mis communication on the first day regarding my room which was sorted out very quickly and efficiently by Vini the Front Desk Manager, for which I was very grateful. I only really ate at the Lotus Caf√© as I was travelling alone and it has a really nice informal atmosphere. The food was outstanding and the chefs made a point of walking round speaking to guests‚Äô ensuring that their meals were the expected quality.  All the waiting staff were very professional and the service was excellent but special thanks go to Rajendra at breakfast who would have a cup of tea over to my table within minutes of me arriving for breakfast and Abhilash in the evening who would chat to me and recommend dishes"
1927,"Our first visit to Mumbai, and we wan't sure what to expect, however this hotel was exceptional, customer service 100%. The restaurants in this hotel are all excellent. Cleanliness 100% .We visited  the Italian restaurant twice both times the food was of high quality, as was the Thai restaurant, All of the staff throughout this hotel are most helpful and friendly, And I hope that the hotel manger is proud of  all his staff members. Would defiantly visit this hotel again"
1928,"Near the airport but in reality cannot access airport more easily than other hotels like hyatt regency.  Looks impressive but few guests in restaurant and bar, perhaps it is new but the location is ho-hum.  A mall is planned next door with more restaurants,"
1929,"I had visited Lotus Cafe for Dinner with my friends on the 17th of October . As always service was mesmerizing, food was delicious. Great team , great people, great service. Special thanks to  Ajay, Vishal and Kiran, you guys really have the passion for customer service. Kuddos to Giles for such great hospitality."
1930,"Well what can I say!  Truly the most wonderful breakfast ever as we walked into the hotel, there were authentic Indian musicians playing love music, the lobby way was filled with beUruful traditional flowers! Very exotic and glamorous!  The self serve breakfast was unbelievable!  Lots of traditional food such as eggs Ô∏èÔ∏èsausages and bacon, as well as continental and cereals... The choice was unbelievable!  For the more varied pallet there was about 30 Indian breakfast dishes (I tried one that was a pancake with chopped spices herbs and vegetables in and it was lovely) also a great self toon of omlettes that were prepared and cooked as you stood watching!  The fresh fruit juice selection was great too... Tomato, pineapple, melon, orange, Apple, kiwi, all gorgeous! Afterwards we"
1931,"Excellent hotel in the outskirts of Mumbai and close (20mins) to the international airport. Located on the Juhu beach, the hotel has a private gate with security guard to enter the beach area. The rooms were clean and well kept, comfortable beds, flat screen tv, fresh fruit in the room, wide range of amenities in the bathroom. Local newspaper delivery every morning. Helpful and attentive staff, both in the reception and elsewhere, ready to solve any question or problem, special mention to the housekeeping staff who made us feel very welcome indeed. Since our flight was very late on the day of our check-out, we wanted to extend our stay but due to the hotel being full booked that night, this was not possible. Instead we got passes with unlimited access to the lobby and pool area"
1932,Worst hotel I have stayed   We were humiliated and insulted when the restaurant refused complementary breakfast and instead served us something else  We are a group of doctors attending MISSICON 2015 conference  We had opted for residential package since we believed that Marriott hospitality will be good  Unfortunately what we got at juhu was humiliation and insult  Had you previously informed us that you will treat conference delegates inferiorly  We would not have opted for residential package but gone to a hotel where we would have been given minimal courtesy  Thanks for making us learn something in addition to what we learnt from conference - never stay in Marriott again
1933,"I have been to J W Marriott on several occasions. Property exteriors resemble to Rajasthani palace and are very inviting. Shopping arcade has wide variety. Food for conferences is generally not upto the mark in taste and variety but otherwise it is good. It is at the heart of the film industry and it is very common to bump in with cine and TV stars. Coffee shop provides good options and nice place to chat, even business briefings. Poolside view is also good. A round to the hotel is a good idea while at Mumbai"
1934,I am a jw marriott member. I booked a stay to celebrate my wedding anniversary & was expecting a nice treatment from hotel staff as they have enquired and I have informed them that it's my marriage anniversary. On reaching hotel No flower bouquet or cake was kept in my room. I tried to book a massage therapy at Quan Spa but only calling 4 times and wasting my one hour I was been able to get a xerox copy of unreadable brochure. I tried to contact Spa manager Kapadia but was informed that she is not available. Hence my wife went to spa directly to enquire about booking a session and was told they are fully  booked but will let know against cancellation so we waited by pool to know in last that noting is arranged. Hence we got back to room. Got ready for dinner and went to Bombay
1935,Me and my mrs stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks.This hotel and it's staff is just AMAZING .We were treated like Royalty by the staff. The room with a Kingside bed and Ocean View was excellent. Food was excellent.Juhu beach accessed by a private gate at the back of the hotel. I  would recommend this hotel. Our 2 week stay was stress free. Thanks to the Management and the staff
1936,"Amazing place to stay with great food. Rooms are well decorated and are well maintained. Would like thank MR. Joydeep, hope I got the name right. Walk by the poolside is a must and staff are smiling and ready to assist."
1937,"I had such a fantastic time at this hotel - the service was impeccable: from the meeting at the airport to check in, to pool service.  I was worried about travelling around Mumbai on my own as a woman, but the concierge was very helpful and planned an itenerary with me.  He booked me a private car service (which I recommend - it's less than the hotel cars!).  My driver was knowledgeable and very friendly and kind.  Even those who cleaned the rooms went out of their way to be kind and make sure you had everything you need.  Walking around in the area was very safe even in the dark.    I had a fantastic time!"
1938,"We chose this over the taj as we are a fun couple that wanted a friendly not to formal environment for our stay. We made the right choice. Right from the point of arrival at security, we were warmly greeted with a friendly smile and welcoming manner. Gurpreet at the door was great, and priyanka at front desk helped us check in swiftly and easily. All in all its a luxury hotel so we had high expectations, to which the hotel itself didn't dissapoint, but it really was the service that made this the best hotel stay for us beating a lot of others around the world. Great service (the lounge on 4th is also wicked thanks ivan and co), great amenities, wide range of food and also great location. Can't reccomend this place enough."
1939,"Had a wonderful week long stay here in September and would definitely return. The staff were very attentive and friendly - a real credit to the hotel. My room was immaculate with gorgeous views over the hotel grounds and beach. Housekeeping did a wonderful job keeping the room spotless. The room service menu was varied - would recommend the vegetarian thali...delicious! Room service was always delivered quite promptly. Only disappointment was that the main pool was closed for maintenance - would have loved to have swam it is as it looked very impression however the other pools were available to use.  Overall, I had a wonderful stay here on my first trip to India...if I come again I would absolutely consider staying here again."
1940,"Rooms are typical, food very good, great wine selection and super service.  Security is top notch and all employees are very helpful.  You definitely need to check out the Sunday buffet!  Pool is great and food served there top notch.  Have stayed there many times and will definitely return."
1941,"This hotel has it all. Lots of good restaurants to choose from, the best pool from all hotels in Mumbai. It gives you that grand feel to it. And is close to the cinemas. Also great seafood restaurant next door. If you have to choose a family hotel, then this is the one. I like the sunday brunch also."
1942,"Stayed @ JW Marriott Juhu,for 2nights mind blowing property..good service nice food... Best part of the hotel is their Gym n The steam room with awesome  jacuzzi. Mr.Mahesh n Mr.Mahesh Patil where excellent boys so active so helpful.They made me feel like a King. Must visit when in Mumbai All The Best  Regards Rohit Bhasin Room No#524. 9th till 11th"
1943,"From the moment we checked in everything was top notch.  The doormen, bellhops, front desk service manager, etc all provided excellent service tending to our every need.  Saif checked us in and provided a ton of upgrades due to my Gold status.  Was given upgraded room, executive lounge access, free breakfast, premium internet, etc.  We could have been happier with room 238.  It was very large - a suite - with a view of the ocean, very clean and had a second bathroom which served our needs perfectly.  Each time we ate, multiple people would ask if we were doing ok and if there was anything we could use.  Truthfully, Id place the level of service above that of The Plaza or Waldorf in NY.  Id highly recommend this hotel should your travels bring you to India.  I don't think you"
1944,"Love the hotel.The staff is very friendly and hospitable. My daughter,husband and I were very comfortable.The Sunday breakfast was just sumptuous! Would just request them to have activities and an elaborate play area for kids. Existing one too small"
1945,"We stayed there for couple of nights. Our room was sea view. Room itself was ok nothing fancy sea view was good. But there gardens & swimming pool area is amazing! We spent a lot of time there walking sitting even we went out walk by the sea. Lunch buffet they had Mumbai street food was 10out of 10. Dinner was not far behind either. Breakfast hot, cold, North Indian, South Indian, continental you name it all was there. Well feed. Very happy with our stay:-)"
1946,Have been to this place numerous times. And it amazes me every single time. The restaurants it has are splendid. Each and everyone is unique.  Me favourite has to be mezzo mezzo.  The Sunday brunch is to starve for the whole week and binge on types.  The whole place is so lovely.  Even the rooms are spectacular  Would love to stay here every month.
1947,"I have dined in this hotel many times however on 2nd Oct 2015 I stayed here with a friend for the first time . I really like the experience of staying here. The hotel is amazingly huge , lot of privacy even in public areas , good service by most staff ( though not all ) , good rooms & very good food ( esp. mutton biriyani & Bombay Bakery Co. ) One of the most memorable things is the musicians playing tabla and bowls full of water on Sat & Sun morning during breakfast - such a pleasant thing in this otherwise animated world . Most of the staff are good and say Namaste , making it warm for all guests . I like this hotel and will recommend to all ."
1948,"I stayed 8 nights at the end of September for business.   My wonderful experience started with check-in. Akansha was so professional, knowledgeable, and helped me settle into my room. She was available throughout my stay to help me out with any issues I had.   Every morning at breakfast Ravi brought my ""usual"" order that he memorized on the first day.   I ordered room service from Sayali for the first 4 evenings. On the 5th night she asked me to come try the Indian restaurant, on the hotel. The food was the best I had on my month-long trip. It was my birthday and the staff brought me a beautiful slice of cake. It's not easy celebrating one's birthday alone but the hotel ensured I had a wonderful day.   A few suggestions for improvement: the wifi could be better, as it was not"
1949,Front office staff are non co operative and very rude and there are so many staff that they don't bother about guest . my payment is charged double by front office staff and I have not received the refund in my card in spite of several reminder via email and telephonically . poor co-operation among team members .   I don't suggest any one to put up J W Marriott in future due to pathetic experience .
1950,We had a fantastic stay at the JW Marriott Juhu Beach. We were greeted as we walked into the hotel and showed to our room with a fantastic ocean view. The staff was always courteous and very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to others. The only downside is the locations. It is quite a far drive to the heart of Mumbai.
1951,From the luxurious complimentary limo transfer from the airport (BMW and Range Rover) to express check-in to free high speed wifi and access to all executive club facilities this was great value luxury. Beats Taj Lands End on all counts. Top floor room with good sea view and complimentary buffet breakfast ‚Äî couldn't ask for more. Definitely the best place to stay in the Juhu Bandra stretch.
1952,The cuisine here is Japanese and Thai and we opted to eat the Japanese food that night. The food was really good and reasonably priced. For a couple the bill was for little bit above USD 100. The ambience was also very well done. Recommended
1953,"This was the 3rd time that I have stayed at the JW Marriott since it opened in 2002.  I consider this hotel to be my ""home away from home"".  During this trip I also stayed a couple nights at The Sahara Star in Andheri and as beautiful of a hotel as the Sahara Star is, I just feel more comfortable at the JW Marriott in Juhu.  This hotel is more open and has a huge lobby.  The location of this hotel is awesome as it is right on the beach and when you walk outside the hotel, there is a plethora of eateries and drinking establishments within walking distance such as Mahesh Lunch Home (seafood...try the masala lobster), Starbucks (a Tata Alliance), Siv Sagar (Pure Veg but awesome food), Domino's Pizza, Ice Cream, and a variety of other places.  Inside the JW Marriott you will find"
1954,"My wife and myself stayed in suite 586 on the 5th floor.  The suite had superb views of the beach and the sea.   From the living room,  the bedroom as well as from the huge bathroom.  The suite was about 600 odd square feet with 2 large flat screen TV's, 2 toilets and a lot of other amenities, as to be expected.  Very very comfortable, indeed.   We dined at all the restaurants ie Lotus Cafe, Arola, Spices, Saffron and Mezzo Mezzo.   Couldn't fault any of them, frankly.  Food was great, service excellent.  I would like to make special mention of the following :  Shahnawaz Shaikh at front office was simply outstanding.  JWM should retain this guy and keep promoting him.  He is a huge asset to your organisation.   At the lounge, we were impressed with Priyesh, Ivan and Sufiyan."
1955,"JW Marriott Juhu makes every effort to exceed their guests' expectations. Check in was smooth and quick. My room preference from my last stay was offered to me, without me mentioning it.  The room was clean and odour free. The view from an executive ocean view room is of the pool and the ocean- good option to take.  The bathroom was huge, well appointed and was kept clean and dry during our stay.  Sleep- comfortable, no disturbances Wifi- complimentary and quick. Breakfast- Huge assortment catering to most cuisine and diet preferences Airport transfer- Nice cars and courteous staff. All in all, a great stay. I would love to go back."
1956,"I have partied in JW Marriott over 100 times. And absolutely love it. Food is delicious,  and especially the sweet dish. Love partying at bankuet hall. Feels like a disco Its a perfect party venue Regards Priyanka Raina (Director / Film Critic)"
1957,I was at the hotel for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay.  The entire staff at the hotel was wonderful and made my stay very comfortable.  The food at the hotel is just amazing.  i wanted to thank Mr. Mehta the Sous Chef for always greeting me at breakfast and making sure the service and quality of food was excellent.   The guest rooms are very spacious and have a wonderful view of the ocean.  Also the hotel is very convenient to various shopping outlets and restaurants.
1958,"This is probably one of the finest hotels I've ever stayed in (and I have stayed in some pretty fancy hotels). What makes a hotel great is not just the ambience and the quality of the building, but it is the people. The staff at the JW Marriott are beyond excellent, they treat their guests as though they are revered family members. My husband and I are so impressed we are thinking of coming back for a week and just relaxing. The view from our room (we were upgraded to a suite) was magnificent, and the garden area is breathtaking. If you are coming to Mumbai, stay here!"
1959,This hotel at Juhu in Mumbai is the finest JW Marriott I have been to across all my travels. Architecture which seems to draw inspiration from the Middle East and a location par excellence. The hotel is designed beautifully with the lobby leading to a flight of stairs on two sides of the coffee shop. Rooms are elegant and food is decent. Its real value for money for the location near the airport and the architecture.
1960,"I visited here for my wife's birthday and stayed here for one night in August'15. I had booked a Premier Club Room.  This is my 3rd stay at Marriott and now I can actual compare the service, hospitality and over all experience at each stay. Please note since we spent handsome amount of money, so all reviews comes considering that as well.  I will give points to all things in below break points:  1)	Booking (2 points): I am adding this point intentionally so that anyone of you who are actually planning to visit for your special occasion not actually get feeling of being cheated. So I have actually call 3 ‚Äì 4 times to make sure what I am getting is correct.  (a)	When I called 1st time it was actually a basic inquiry and I did the booking. (b)	2nd time I get into the details and"

1962,"This is a worst hotel ever stayed with utter unprofessionalism. Although in a good location but lacks basic safety guidelines.   Stayed in the hotel from 14-Sept and checked out today on 16-Sept. Room# 319. The stay was very bad on 14th night to be precise 15th Morning at 2:50am they had a fire-alarm which went off waking all the guests on 3rd floor and had to evacuate the hotel via stairs. There were people with little kids. This was not a problem but issue was:- By stairs when people came down about 60-70 people, door of the lobby exit was locked, 1st floor door was locked and lower lobby was open but it came out in mud and it was raining that particular night  The hotel wasn't aware of the alarm, we had to rush out in rain, drench ourselves and go to the reception to inform"
1963,We heard the name of JW in Mumbai. Very third grade service. All over experience was totally unsatisfied. Staffs are not friendly.They have attitude problem. They promise something and we do not get what they promise.
1964,This is a good choice for business. The price is correct for this kind of hotel. It's not far from the airport which is very convenient when you arrive in the night and leave in the night (20 minutes drive). There is a service of pick up and drop off. The room is well furnished and modern. The bad point to highlight is the fact that it's always at 18 degre celcius when you arrive and it's impossible to cut completely the air cond (max 21 degre).
1965,"I would appreciate the property for many reason, to name few of them...the staff and their behaviour is recommendable, very helpful. The rooms are cozy and well done. Food is good and varieties you think about. Good service. Surely I would like to come back again whenever I am traveling to Mumbai next, and will recommend my friends and colleagues."
1966,"Checked in late and there was a slight problem with my booking. Front desk staff was very helpful and they solved the problem right away. They also upgraded me to a club room due to the delay. That is what I call service!  Bunch on Sunday morning was spectacular. Great selection and awesome service. Kudos to whole service team.   Rooms are very well designed. All amenities you can ask for. Little more light in the bathroom would be nice, hard to shave with low light.  Wish I could have stayed longer. Will be my address every time I come to Mumbai"
1967,"This hotel is perfect for business travellers in Mumbai.  Now the sea link is in operation you are only 2 hours from Mumbai Central.  You are a short hop from the airport and most local business areas.  Wit a great selection of food and everything you would expect from Marriott, what sets this place aside is the dedication of the staff!  Best in the world"
1968,"Stayed in this hotel for a night for business trip. It was overall nice and pleasant stay with some lovely surprises. At the time of cheking my room was upgraded to premium Sea facing room with a complimentary lucky draw and with free wifi, In Draw, i got two free pints of BEER !!! checkin was very smooth,  Room was very spacious and luxurious. and with a very nice direct sea view. which was not crowded.  Breakfast sprad was very good with lot of Indian varieties as well as English breakfast, taste was good and it was not extra ordinary  Only disappointing part of the stay was dinner at Arola restra( Said to be Spanish ), Food was not at all at par with Spanish style, it was ordinary Indian style with nice plating - So this can be avoidable if you stay there."
1969,"Based on past reviews we decided to stay in this hotel as we needed to be near the suburbs. Overall the staff were very helpful and the accommodation was very clean and the bed was as comfy as a cloud. I was pleased with the stay and amenities.   As we had a third guest for 5 nights, we upgraded to a Premier Club in order to accommodate the rollaway bed. This room was roomy enough for the 3 guests. It also gave us access to the Executive lounge for Breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes. Due to one food allergy and a one fear of getting ""delhi belly"" (as we had gotten quite sick on our last overseas trip) we visited regularly. The team at the Executive lounge were very approachable, friendly and helpful. The Dosa's and Pan made for us were delicious and they were happy to make"
1970,"My first stay with the Marriott group was with JW Marriott in August 2015. It‚Äôs a huge hotel. Beautifully constructed.   It was a business trip. The reason I chose this hotel was that it was close to my work area.   Deluxe Guest Room was not very spacious,  decent enough for just two. I think with kids a deluxe room will not be very comfortable.  Free Wifi speed is good.   The housekeeping disappointed me. I left the room for a meeting and there was no evening turndown service when I came back at around 11 pm. I requested for one and the guy who came in was like a storm.   The food at their coffee shop is very good. Buffet is decently priced. The staff manages the guests very well specially during the crowded breakfast hours.   The swimming pool looks awesome. I never got the"
1971,"Had a very nice and splendid time, The ambiance and location was awesome. I stayed in the Executive Beach View room which was neat and had a nice beach view from the room. The service was good. I would love to stay here whenever i am in Mumbai."
1972,Hi Its a Nice Place to have business Meeting in At business center equipped with all necessary things i have conducted few interviews and explained my need to hotel they are very supportive in the same
1973,"this is one of best hotels that i have stayed in Mumbai, the location is also very porsche and the ambience of the place is just mind blowing. it is also one of the best hotel of JW Marriot that I have stayed in my life.   I Just love this place. you can visit this place with family and with Friends also"
1974,"Me ,my wife and my daughter stayed jw Marriott on our holi festival celebration and it was just awesome due to this hotel. After check in we spend all the times in the same hotel and it's around. All the besties on around so we had a great time there . Hotels breakfast was awesome, great view right on the beach. Mumbai's famous juhu beach and chaupati is nearby. Staff was very helpful and kind , rooms are beautiful sea view but little small. Over all 5 stars and up to the mark. Highly recommend."
1975,"There are definitely much better hotels in Mumbai - and at better rates - but if you need to be in the Juhu area in order to avoid the nightmarish traffic, then the Marriot is likely your best bet. The hotel is in an ugly old building likely from the seventies, and despite recent refurbishment in a number of rooms, the architectural basics unfortunately cannot be fixed. The building is U shaped, and the most unfortunate architectural choice is the fact that all rooms are angled towards the sea, and each has a large triangular area in front of the full height windows that attracts tons of pigeons, and gathers their droppings. This means that what should be a lovely sea view is basically a rather unpleasant sea view. The other major element of poor planning shows in the fact that"
1976,"The brand name itself is enough. The location, is fantastic. Service varies. Rooms are good.  The overall ambience is awesome.  Multicuisine food - quality average. However major problem is no two wheeler parking and no drop to railway station which is quite embarassing."
1977,Lotus cafe was the talk of the town. There was no better buffet thanthis place but now its really bad no taste no variety  the desserts look so out of place. The quality of food was really bad. Veg non-veg being cooked together. Certainly not a recommended place. The choice for vege is really bad
1978,"Visited the hotel for an all day event taking place at the hotel . Due to the traffic decided to take my two wheeler on getting to the hotel was stopped at the gate by the hotel guards saying there is no parking for two wheelers. How can your hotel not have two wheeler parking facilities for guest . To add to that the guards were not at all helpful to even help us find an alternative parking around the hotel, they were just busy fighting amongst themselves and plus the profanity did not help. Anyway i found a place to park and came by foot and attended the event . The hotel is beautiful but because of the unpleasant start i could not enjoy the day ."
1979,"This JW doesn't live upto the standards that I have come to expect based stays at other JW locations.  The Room had a certain shabbiness to it with stains on the sofa that needs to be replaced, power outlets and lights not working, etc.  There is a lack of attention to detail.  The staff are very courteous and friendly - perhaps, overly friendly as they often tend to wait around after making their greeting - as if they are expecting a tip - its a very uncomfortable feeling.    The best wait staff are those that are there when you need them, but not intrusive to the point of being annoying.  The service in the restaurants is slow and again lacks that attention to detail. The food selection is great, with a very wide buffet selection.  I will not be rushing back to here with so"
1980,"I stay here with my family, everytime we visit India. We all love this hotel. Tons of shopping and great restaurants close by within walking distance. I have stayed atleast 5 to 6 times. The sea view rooms are beautiful. The lounge has amazing food. The service is bit slow at times but overall everyone is friendly and very welcoming. The morning buffet is the BEST."
1981,"The Marriott Juhu is well located for getting about the large sprawling city of Mumbai.  The hotel is spacious with a variety of restaurants and bars.  Bedrooms are comfortable with the usual facilities, excellent beds and pillows you would expect of a JW Marriott hotel. Great bathroom and international plug sockets well located throughout. The staff were pleasant and helpful, particularly the concierge team and housekeeping staff who were brilliant.  Wifi at the hotel was fantastic (the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at) and available throughout the premises.  The only complaint I could have was that the bedrooms are dark, even when fully lit at night.  And as an observation, this hotel is much more anonymous than the airport JW Marriott where you really get the feeling"
1982,"I stayed in January this year with my family, though I know this property very well as I have lived in Mumbai and was a frequent visiter. so all is well there. What to say actualy they are good in all fields, like breakfast, rooms, swimming pool, disco thek, and even I have organised one party there and that was also well done."
1983,Nice rooms with stunning sea views. The buffet at Lotus is nice but not outstanding. We also tried out the asian restaurant it was just okay nothing great. Small but nice swimming pool. Usually a crowded hotel needs slight upgradation. All in all a nice hotel if coming to Mumbai then it is a good choice.
1984,"I checked in today in a Premium Club Room with Executive Club access. Hotel is beautiful, location is amazing with a sea view, check in was smooth but at the Executive Lounge I had to wait for 1 hour for a cup of tea..... Not acceptable.... That's not enough even after an hour the tea which got served was horrible.....how can you have such a horrible service????"
1985,I received two nights of a complementary stay at this property in redemption of an exceptionally horrible experience at the Courtyard by Mariott at Andheri which i have covered in TA.  was upgraded to an executive suite- superb sea view silent room . The breakfast spread was huge but a bit cold and noisy / crowded on Sunday. The service levels were however very high with chefs in personal attandance.  The property is well maintained and stylish and the gym is superb
1986,"I liked the Rooms of this hotel, ambience is superb It was at perfect location for my buiness. I also liked the pool area and lounge bar at the hotel. I was totally amazed with the services of the hotel staff and crew."
1987,nice place sea viiew is owsm. reaching is dficult  nice service staff service nice i was there in 2014 at one evevent show gooog place for party and wedding evevnt seminar nice location difrent kind of dishes
1988,"Great choices of restaurants. Fantastic pool and gym. the rooms have a great view of the ocean. the brunches here are one of the best i have ever seen. there every sunday with the family, its a no-brainer."
1989,"This hotel is luxurious to the MAX!! From the moment you drive on property, first and foremost you are greeted by each and every employee with a humble welcome, a smile and a bow. I couldn't help but return the gesture. Then as the doorman opens the glass doors to welcome you in your are fixed on the huge and beautiful lobby alive with action as you see your fellow patrons sitting and happily chatting here and there. You safely go up the elevator which only allows the car to move by swiping your room key. The Marriott lounge is stocked and staffed well. The rooms are all clean clean clean and fitted with a super comfortable bed and bedding. This is the finest hotel in my companies system and I jump at the chance to fly to Mumbai specifically because I know I'll be staying here."
1990,"had booked a club room, was picked up in a land rower suv, good, well mannered drivers, was offered a good bottle of cold water. reached the hotel. was escorted to my room, which had a good view of the arabian sea and the swimming pool. later went to the executive lounge, where tea and coffee are served through out the day. good for alcohol drinkers, as it is served complimentary from 5.30 pm to 9 pm, drink as much as you can and eat as much as you can. ce i am a non drinker, i had a good mocktail. and did enjoy the kababs and the live chat counter. next day evening decided to have some panipuris and save puris, which i really love, had a walk through the hotel , around the swimming pool. there was a door leading directly to the beach, which they opened for me. had a good walk"
1991,One should definitely visit this hotel. Amazing breakfast..ambience electrifying. .disc amazing.. restaurant mind blowing. .we went there for just a day shopped at juhu and stayed at jw marriot .rooms are very spacious a bit pricey.. but overall a must visit hotel
1992,"A decent hotel in its category. Provides beach access, and welcome gift, and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff is a little haughty, and the in room menu is very limited. The backyard of the hotel is particularly nice to walk around, but you might not want to go to the public beach."
1993,"The spread was designed in the manner that was just perfect, nothing less nothing more. Wish there were more vegetarian food. The breads were served fresh . The request to prepare less spicy & oily vegetable was gladly accepted & the chef did a fantastic preparation of the greens. Just enjoyed the deserts."
1994,Awesome hotel and good location me and my family visited lotus cafe for lunch staff was well trained and food was awesome special thanks to the lady oyster who was in the lobby and the way she helped my old  grandma it is an example of true hospitality.
1995,"I have had a weekend planned with my friend at this hotel, I have had many stays at J W Marriott - Somehow I never feel welcome at this hotel, I just don't know why. This time I decided to write the review.   At the front desk while checking in I offered my debit card and the guy on front desk refused to take debit card, yes DEBIT CARD - he asked me to get cash from ATM - I made a visit to ATM inside the hotel which was not loaded and I could take only 50% of the amount.   The guy on front desk kept insisting on cash or credit card but said no for taking credit card, I told him that I will leave the hotel and asked to see the manager who finally talked sense into the guy and finally my DEBIT CARD was approved.   At the time of dinner, JW Cafe was full at 2200 hours (Buffet"
1996,"I stay at the JW Marriott at least twice a month and consider it my home away from home.  First of all, I really enjoy the buffet breakfast which starts promptly at 630am each day.  All the staff is fantastic, from the chefs to the waiters, to the busboys, etc.  One individual who stands out as someone who really enjoys his job and who wants to make sure I always get whatever it is I ask for is Rajendra.  ""Raj"" always has a smile on his face, is always eager to please and never misses replacing used with clean silverware and dishes.    I also frequent the Executive Club on the 4th floor and Ivan as well as the other staff members there always greet me by first name and make me feel like family.  The wait staff at the Executive Lounge are tops as well.  They remember what you"
1997,"A 7-star hotel,unblemished and splendid!I had been there on my birthday and am so elated I was there.It was one of my best birthday.The buffet had so much to offer.From kachoris and pani puris to south indian cuisines,it was painted with a complete meal,my tummy would crave for!Although I haven't stayed there but would love to!"
1998,"Touted to be one of the best hotels in Mumbai region, JW Marriott certainly failed to impress me.. The rooms (base category) are very small & completely occupied with 1 big bed. There is hardly any space for people to move around. We had booked 2 rooms for our family & had asked them (at the reception) to give us 2 king bed in each. Even after waiting for 20-25 mins one of our rooms had 2 single beds. It took them another 35 mins to to get us the desired room. Food is excellent. However, the service is way off. Its always super crowded over the weekends & takes them hell lot of time to attend to the guests. You need to remind them atleast twice to serve water etc. I also happen to be a member of the Marriott club and the rules laid down (not mentioned during purchasing the"
1999,"Traveling across the world it is comforting to know some things can be counted on. The property was ideally located, the rooms were well appointed, and the staff was very accommodating.   I am a Marriott rewards member but not at the top levels so I was very surprised and delighted when I was upgraded at no charge at check in. My room was very comfortable and I'm fairly certain the bathroom was the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel room. Plus I could see the Arabian Sea from my room. What a treat. I felt spoiled!  If I ever travel back to Mumbai, I will pick this hotel again. Everything was perfect!"
2000,"I stayed in the JW Marriott Juhu from 28th Feb for 7 nights on business with a colleague.  This was my first time in India and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel.  I stayed in an executive room and had fresh flowers delivered on arrival, a really nice touch (and lasted all week!).  The room was spacious and well appointed, with a great view of the beach and pool area.  I dined at the hotel most nights and found the selection of restaurants really impressive.  I also enjoyed room service and the Bombay Bakery Club on a few occasions.  Had a great meal every time.  The service from all the food and beverage staff was superb.  I used the spa twice which was a nice treat, again the standard of treatment and service was fabulous.  Pool area is to die for, perfect for a lazy"
2001,"I stayed at the hotel on 11 and 12 August. The driver who picked us from the airport was trying to take us some handicraft shops on way to hotel to do some shopping, which we declined. Obviously he would be getting some commission from the purchase we would make. Rooms are very well maintained. The staff are very courteous and helpful. The breakfast buffet is superb. One thing which surprised us that the hotel had nothing extra to offer for a silver member of the loyalty program. No room upgraded. No discounts on room service. I wonder why I have enrolled for their loyalty program. Overall a good place to stay when staying near the beaches of Mumbai."
2002,"This is a beautiful hotel by the beach marred by poor service.  Actually, I only had 5 issues with the service:  1) My hotel rate included airport pick-up, but despite agreeing several times to confirm my pick-up time and confirmation number by email, I never received such confirmation email.    2) The in room wifi was free for me, but it was intermittent - the connection was dropped many times, making it difficult to use sky or other services that require steady connextion.      3) The conceirge service was poor.  I asked if there was a personal trainer available on Saturday at the gym for yoga and was told that by the conceirge that he would look into it and call me at my room.  4 Hours later, I received a call that indeed car service was available for Saturday.  How he went"
2003,"My first experience to stay in one of the best hotel of India. It was a memorable experience thanks to outstanding team members. We stayed here for two nights ,we felt confortable from the second we entered the building. Highly recommended !!"
2004,"comfortable stay... apart from other hotels, i stayed here early this month as i usually come for business in mumbai. everything is fine, though sometimes the staff gets complacent. its a fine location in the suburbs."
2005,Its one of our favourite  places .  The ambience  is awesome .  Spend a leisurely  afternoon  there  with a splendid  view. The coffee  shop or the lounge  on the 1st floor is a great  place  to be. Kids too enjoy  the open space  n cosy atmosphere.
2006,I was blown away by the excellent service levels that were provided at the hotel. Each and every staff that passed by you greeted you and made you feel more than welcome. The Sous chefs Mehta and the other gentleman whose name I forget were very forthcoming at the breakfast buffet. Ivan at the executive lounge was very professional in his approach and offered superior customer service. If I ever want to own a hotel then I would want to implement the service standards that are offered at the Marriott Juhu. I would like to see more activities for older kids at the hotel to keep them entertained throughout the day. The hotel makes you feel that you are not in Mumbai but is yet in the heart of it.
2007,"Beautiful property, great location and great staff! Very friendly and accommodating. Got an upgrade to a room overlooking the beach. Great restaurants and beautiful swimming pool. Thanks for an incredible stay!"
2008,This place is amazing to have the most luxurious feel. They provide you the best of hospitality with classy crowd. I had a coffee over there and then I went to attend my coca cola annual general meeting.
2009,"We spent a weekend in Mumbai in early August staying at the Marriott Hotel Juhu. We had won the weekend stay at a charity event and had done nothing about booking until the certificate had expired by a few days. Thanks to the generosity of the Marriott they lets have the weekend stay anyway. We also purchased the up grade to the Marriott Club lounge which was on the same floor as our room, this was excellent and great value.  The room was very nice, full size bath and great facilities, we used the pool and out sun lounging area which was nice, clean and well maintained.  We went through the back gate to the beach for a walk, this is a typical India experience, unfortunately the beach was  littered with al-sorts of rubbish, maybe it was due to it being Monsoon Season but it is a"
2010,"Love the hotel, they probably have the best breakfast I have ever had in any hotel! The food is amazing! The pool is great very clean and not crowded at all. Service is awesome. Rooms are very clean.Have only good things to say about the stay. But the food is just delicious!!!"
2011,"The only hotel to stay in when you're in the Juhu area. An amazing experience with excellent service, quality of food and location. The breakfast catered for all request even if items were not on the standard list."
2012,"Great Hotel - Mostly Bollywood crowd, Good disc. i have been here multiple times. If you are looking for young , filmi, Bollywood crowd with dance and masti , this is the place in Mumbai. Great music is played and awasome crowd. It's near juhu beach , great varity of food and drinks."
2013,The whole experience right from the stay to the food to the location and ambience ....everything about the hotel was fantastic.  The staff be it catering or reception or club lounge was extremely courteous and helpful.  They have a separate kiddie pool with a massive slide which was a huge hit with my kids.   The food was delicious and we were always very well taken care of by the chef and his team. The hotel has its own private gate to the beach.....which was a bonus.  Overall  fantastic stay ....would love to go again.
2014,"Me and my wife had a wonderful breakfast experience at coffee shop on 31st July 15. Impeccable service,lovely food, beautiful ambience, soothing music at entrance, TRULY WONDERFUL. We will surely want to stay in your hotel and experience the overall experience of the hotel After having such a wonderful experience at breakfast. Thank you."
2015,Big spacious hotel located on Juhu beach.  Very comfortable place to stay.    The Lotus Cafe is great with lots of variety.  The hotel also has a good Italian and wonderful Spanish restaurant.  The rooms are big and the bed is very comfortable. The staff is very friendly.   I have stayed at this hotel twice and would return again.
2016,the room and amenities a let down. staff very helpful and courteus the check in was smooth. their nightclub has shut down . the restraunt turn away in house guest which is very strange. overall a average hotel
2017,"Located on Juhu beach Jw Marriott is the right place to stay , both for business and holiday. Rooms are good , nice ambiance , good restaurants for food  ( Indian , Italian , ) and 2 bars. value for money ."
2018,"Room spacious, bed comfy, executive lounge with ample choice...this hotel is an oasis of calm and luxury.  Nothing is too much of a trouble and the smallest of requests are noted and fulfilled.  Can not recommend it highly enough.  A sincere 10/10."
2019,"I went to JW marriott for business purposes, conference hall , buffet, swimming pools and room are 5-star, I'm vey satisfied. Nice and professional staff. But a little bit disappointed when the outlook of building is quite old, looks not really clean and luxury."
2020,"1 night in jw marriot juhu n its feel like u r in goa.go for sea view rooms only they are best.bakers cafe is ok and saffron is good.definetly recommended if u r looking for juhui hotel,bit far from colaba but airport is very near"
2021,"Good, spacious room.  Excellent wi-if.  Staff friendly and efficient - lots of them.  Enjoyed the buffet dinners in the Lotus cafe as small portions of lots of styles of food good for changing appetites over the week stay.  Breakfasts in the same place plenty to choose for UK style or more exotic.  Food orders all promptly dealt with and chefs seemed genuinely happy to explain about the dishes on offer. The hotel is on the beach which gives a cooling breeze for a walk about.  Not hassled once on the beach or surrounding area - unlike tourist Mumbai where it is a real pain. 2nd stay and looking forward to the next."
2022,"Great Property. Rooms are excellent. Sea view from rooms directly facing the sea is very good. Food is excellent. Coffee Shop, Spice etc all restaurant are very good. Buffet Spread is very good. Oriental Food specially sushi is worth mentioning. A really a five star experience."
2023,"My first stay at a Marriott and what an utterly pampered, luxurious experience! The Meridien in Delhi was excellent, but this is another world altogether. A mixup meant that I had actually booked the other Mumbai Marriott, quite a bit cheaper, but the Juhu Marriott honoured the rate. Friendly, professional, courteous staff, excellent food (which is rare for a vegetarian like me). Top-level security, with all the trimmings and an adorable sniffer dog. The poolside is so completely beautiful, we never bothered with the beach just over the wall, except to stroll down to the Chowpatty for local snacks and my favourite Fallooda and scrumptious sweet paan. You may not get the same deal as I was afforded, but you MUST find the budget for this at least once in your life."
2024,I stayed here for business for 4 days. The room is very comfortable with cosy bed and big enough for a single or couple but definitely  not big enough with kids. Had ocean view but I must admit that they can do with a bit of cleaning of the outside balcony as it's occupied by bird droppings.. the entrance is grand and so is the architecture of the building even though some of the areas are a bit run down. Definitely the gym facilities are great with a fairly large swimming pool. . There is a no drinks policy by the pool which shocked us but no big deal... also the Mexican bar is located nicely away facing the beach. .
2025,"As a massive Bollywood fan my stay was made even more incredible by the 4 Bollywood stars I got to meet in the hotel! The location is good for the main shopping area (Santa Cruz) and you also feel very safe although the hotel is on the public beach. We were 3 in a room so it was a bit of a squeeze as the rooms are a lot smaller than you'd imagine. We were able to use the executive suite and the staff there were absolutely amazing and friendly, always ready and willing to talk about anything. The breakfast was great but as we stayed there for around 2 weeks it did get less appealing by the day due to repetitiveness. We got a complimentary dinner but weren't very impressed with it. We were kept given apples and bananas which are such basic fruits when the local fruit is so much"
2026,I frequently visit this wonderful hotel.  The beds are heavenly and the staff is wonderful.  Rajendra in the amazing dinning room downstairs will take care of your every need. The entire dinning staff is always there to bring you the most delicious treats and teas. The rooms are lovely and the views are unique. Come and see Mumbai through the comfort of JW Marriott
2027,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks on business. The hotel is great and in a nice location right on the beach. The rooms aren't massive, I had enough space for me, there was a desk and the WiFi worked well. The gym was well equipped (even if the free weights were very limited) and the pool was lovely. The buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner always had a superb selection and if you wanted something in particular then the chefs would order it and cook it for you. Overall I had a lovely stay."
2028,"We have been staying there pretty regularly, and we have always requested a beach front room at the time of booking. We are gold members plus marriott vacation services gold member. We were disappointed that in spite of making it clear at the reception, we were given one standard reply. ""No rooms available with a beach view"". Very disappointed. The breakfast is good, but i normally stay there for a week, the same menu everyday makes it boring."
2029,I've been hear the rooms are good and big  the people are very nice and sweet the swimming pool is big and nice the food is very good  there are many options in food the fitness centre is big and nice its worth 5 star they treat you like long and queens.
2030,Probably one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had.  The website and staff misrepresented the executive lounge as being open to all yet my three year old was not allowed resulting in us not being able to use the lounge.  Very insenstive team related to that and ofcourse having paid for that the hotel made no attempt to offer us a meal or anything in lieu outside of saying that they would bring things to my room- confining us to the room.  The next day there is a cloud of fumes as they decide that its ok to pain and bang and repair another room- no warning no notice and a horrible smell.  I was then switched after I had to make a stink about it.  The family lounge as they call it was rented out to a corporate event so not usable by anyone else.  The activity center has a
2031,"I had booked a Juhu executive suite on 3rd July for a friends Bday party. Its an excellent hotel with wonderful staff. we had some people coming for the party so went for an upgrade and booked the presidential suite , WOW what a suite ... beautiful view of the ocean and very well done. the best part is the staff is very flexible and accommodating, never said no for anything and always suggested what we can do for a more enjoyable stay. they even allow food and liquor from outside which is a great thing. special thanks to all the lovely help desk managers (Rianne, pascoal, and the staff both hemant's and suresh and also the service boy Sachin) thanks a lot for all the help and smiles you threw at us , will definitely visit n stay again"
2032,We checked in on 5th evening after coming from aamby value.....booked a premium club room as comparatively bigger than the previous room.. but the bed size was not enough for three persons like 2 adults n 1 child... rest evrything was great. Two shower places including the bath tub.. food was great had a variety of items in breakfast.. normally not in all fuve star properties. It was an amazing exp... being there for 2 nites..would like to stay again.
2033,Most Coffee shops in ***** Hotels are cranny and have a seating space for 80-100 pax  But no not The Lotus Cafe  It is a Huge Lobby with Multi Cuisine Buffet available 24x7  It also has a lavish A La Carte Menu and a Bar Menu having Both Domestic and Imported Brews and Spirits.  The whole vibe is something I have witnessed no where else . Best place to have a Late night drink and absolutely satisfying Buffet
2034,"I went to enjoy my week end with my family and it was the best week end my son enjoyed it the most,the breakfast is huge, the food in the restaurant is fab, the pool and the sea is just wonderful to have a great time. And Pavithran Nambiar the General Manger is very very helpful."
2035,Superb food in the late night near Juhu. You'll love the place. Even you can go late night beach walk. Stay was good there. Really enjoyed the stay there. Love the food. Group place. Really enjoyable. Even you'll find good management. Love to visit again and again
2036,"This is one of the finest hotels in Mumbai! The rooms are nice and spacious..the breakfast at the Lotus Cafe is delicious! The highlight of the Hotel is the Swimming pool..it is huge offering beautiful views during sunset! Overall, a pleasant stay!"
2037,Perfect Location. Extremely pleasant ambiance. Not sure what standard rooms are like but Premier rooms will steal your breath. Every staff will treat you like a king. Perfect reflection of the age old Indian maxim- Guest is God.
2038,"It's a great hotel for conferences, meetings and private parties! The overall food whether ala carte or buffet is very average. The cakes/ deserts are very good. It's falls in the western suburb of Mumbai i.e. in Juhu."
2039,Must say the hotel has improved a lot from last few years . do like the the way everyone at the hotel ( staff wise ) greet you !  the service is first class . rooms are well prepared  .  & what can you say about the pool !!  just great !!!!
2040,I decided to surprise my husband with a luxurious stay for just the two of us . We stay in mumbai and didn't want to travel out of the city because we were having a very hectic week. Considering my limited options I decided to pick jw Marriott as the place to stay and was definitely not dissspointed . Compared to the hotels in mumbai Marriot had a lovely  property. Staff was friendly and helpful . We did pick an sea facing room which added on to the magic . Rooms were not spacious but clean and cosy. I had informed the hotel that we would be celebrating my husbands birthday and they arranged to get us a complimentary cake . We dined at Mezo Mezo and relaxed at the pool side . It was indeed a gateway from the city without being out of it . So if you are looking for something on
2041,"Overall a great hotel, keep visiting for last 10 years at least! However, continual service failures keep me frustrated. On 20 June they failed to pick me up neither respond to me email complaints!  this cost me hours of grief, and of no concern to JW Marriott staff  On arrival on 20 June at Mumbai airport could  find no rep for JW , called JW from my RSA roaming number, costing me a fortune, and never got an answer or never got put through to various persons with no help. i have experienced this many times, it s almost impossible to get through to the hotel.  I had various excuses, but the Marriott rep at the airport had disappeared and a person from another hotel called him after i had been tired of waiting.  the had forgotten to fetch me and wanted to send the vehicle from"
2042,"Flaming torches greet you at the entrance. The hotel  is a bit confusing as it is on different levels.Once you enter of course the sheer expanse of the area, flowing seamlessly to different restaurants and rooms charms you instantly. The view of the pool and the sea beyond is breathtaking. Well appointed rooms and excellent food ensure that just being here is a vacation."
2043,"First time to Mumbai, heard it was the best, turned out be very good, and well located, but with a few flaws also, never experienced before nobody picked the phone at the reception for 10 mins, the locker's battery was down, had to get it replaced.  But everything was dominated by the great Breakfast."
2044,"Thank you for a perfect stay! Very helpful staff, great view, great food, will highly recommend it. The only minor minus was that my room was located in front of the Exec Lounge which gave me sleepless night til around midnight and again from 5 am. So make sure you are not in 447. other than that it is amazing"
2045,"Faced few issues with hot water not coming in sink,  room card not working etc but still worth it as it's a great location,  grand coffee shop, super sea views, awesome swimming pool grounds, special thanks to vini,neha and shambhavi for making our Stay memorable."
2046,"I stay at this hotel once a year and I just love it every time! They surprise with the improvement in their already superb hospitality and service. It has many positives - firstly the location (right in Juhu, next to the beach); then the front-office staff (although it took me 3 hours to get a room even though I was promised 1 hour...the only negative I encountered during all my stays); lavish spread during breakfast (I just love the breakfast variety here and the interactions by the chefs...they just make sure that you enjoy your breakfast and get what you want/like... and they are just awesome!!!); the health club & spa; the pool, the restaurants, the rooms, the housekeeping (liked the way towels were arranged in different shapes at times) - everything is just too good! It's"
2047,"Always stop at JW before heading back home to England. So close to the Airport. Location is ideal. Great facilities and close to Juhu beach if you wish to go for a stroll. Also close to Santa Cruz, Irla, etc. If you wish to shop. Met up with Ananksha at Reception who is always charming and helpful. The Executive lounge is a cool place to hang around and sipp cups of coffee. Staff also very helpful when I needed to computing facilities to reconfirm flight back home. Great bookshop too. Best of all are the breakfast options. Variety to quench every thirst and stimulate every taste bud with food options.. Western or Eastern. Staff excel at all they do. What a way to end our holiday."
2048,"Truly a business friendly hotel with excellent service. Only stayed for one night and was impressed with the advice and hospitality. Will return back for a longer stay. Thank you to Vijay at the front desk for arranging the taxi for me. Pity I could go to the beach due to the monsoon weather, hotel is located on the beach... wOW."
2049,"My husband and I were visiting Bombay and stayed at this Marriott for two nights. We thought the location was fantastic because it is close to lots if shopping and great restaurants. The breakfast buffet was amazing with a variety of fresh fruit juices, lots of pastries, an omelette station, paratha station, Pao bhaji station, dosa station and plenty of fresh fruit. We really enjoyed our daily buffets. On the last day the chef brought out a Bon voyage cake which was very tasty and took pictures with the chef. The pool was amazing. Very relaxing and clean.the hotel bar was really nice as well. We will be staying here next time!!"
2050,Located in prime location with a fantastic view and great star services. If you have a high budget then it is a great place to stay. Services is good and staff is very cooperative.  Ball room is enormous with high people capacity. Ideal place for corporate meetings and business discussions.
2051,"J W Marriott, Juhu has one of the most stunning view of the Arabian sea in Mumbai.   The location makes this hotel a perfect getaway for a weekend leisure trip. My kids love the pool and the food at Saffron and Lotus cafe is simply amazing. The rooms are spacious, provided you are in a higher category room.  The staff  at Lotus Cafe during breakfast hours does an amazing job with all the tables occupied most of the time. They take care of guests needs in quick time and always have  a courteous attitude towards the guests. Also, a special mention of the staff at the front office, Akanksha  Sen in particular goes out of the way to ensure that the guests needs are always addressed and they feel special.  In case you are a cocktails freak, do catch hold of Abhishek in the Reflection"
2052,"Excellent property, awesome view & location. Clean room & professional & friendly staff. Room service was quick enough, food was excellent. Got early check in which is a very good customer service which I liked the most."
2053,"Chose this location as it was close to my office ... And would return in a flash! This large hotel has a prime location on Juhu beach, closed off from the hustle and bustle of this incredible city. Once inside, the cool calm tranquility descends and the attentive  staff do their stuff.   Rooms are not huge but are well appointed, beds ultra comfortable and the bathrooms have a bath should one desire. Linen gorgeous and the views out into the Indian top them off!  The pool is large and has lots of private areas and the walkway to the beach is easy to access.   The hotel itself has many restaurants and bars. The main bar has some of them best staff spinning cocktails I have seen and the atmosphere is pretty cool. Good music, spacious and choice aplenty.   The main restaurants"
2054,"Beautiful view of the beach and a spectacular, spacious room. Service was great and very prompt. Staff is very helpful. Food was good too. Loved the experience. Would definitely recommend this to everyone going to Mumbai."
2055,"this is my favorite hotel , i used to be in jw chandigarh, mumbai and this is is the best and i dont want to be separated from it. The rooms are excellent, best for parties, official meetings. I love it."
2056,Beautiful gated hotel with a grand lobby. More important was the quality staff who spoke excellent English and were extremely pleasant. Luxurious rooms with lots of extra details. Delicious authentic Indian food...even treated to a tour of the kitchen and the fascinating tandoori oven.
2057,With my past experience I recommend JW MARRIOTT Juhu Mumbai for a high level conference on 15th May 2015. However I had an unexpected experience that I hadn't ever dream of.  My clients were locked up in a room without any door handles to pull open for over 20mins.  The general manager was not available for comments/apologies.
2058,"It was a great experience...although the back yard of the hotel ( which includes the garden and pool area) is not that big, but the view i.e overlooking the Juhu beach is fantastic...JW Marriott is a normal five/seven start hotel..however the best part that struck me was the level of personalisation...the staff made us feel at home...right from the check in to the room service...especially the chef, the staff at the restaurant were splendid..they made us feel at home...I can go again and again...."
2059,"We had a beautiful holiday at this beach-front resort in Mumbai.  It was beautiful to laze by the infinity pool, enjoy time at the amazing lobby, have meals at the huge cafeteria and have a lovely walk at the Juhu beach.  Ours was a sea facing room.  One could simply sit and watch the world go by."
2060,"i stayed there for 3 nights ,food is good.The hotel itself was good, nice rooms and good.facilities.20 minutes from airport. Beautiful spacious lobby with view of pools .pool area very nice, Room was very clean and bed was comfy.wifi is free only if ur a rewards member."
2061,"I stayed for four nights.  Hotel is located in a bustling area about 20 minutes from airport. Beautiful spacious lobby with view of pools and the sea. Room was very clean and bed was comfortable.  Only complaint was that I couldn't set the thermostat low enough for my comfort (and why do hotels all insist on those huge duvets even in hot climates ? Breakfast buffet was excellent - nice selection of foods from several cultures.  I became addicted to masala dosa - freshly made for me, and chef loved it when I filmed his technique !  Live music from local performers added a nice atmosphere. Really appreciated the 24/7 open fitness center and pool. Service was attentive.  Used car service several times and drivers were prompt, polite, and got me there alive. Lots of locals at the"
2062,"The hotel itself was lovely, nice rooms and great facilities (I particularly loved the bookshop attached to the Bombay Bakery).  The staff were also very friendly.  However there were certain issues which I found unacceptable for a supposedly five star hotel.  Firstly, it was poor that Wi-Fi was not included in the room charge.  Apparently it is free for Marriott Rewards members, however as my number was not added at check in, so I had to pay.  Secondly, the wait for room service was too long.  On all three occasions that I ordered room service I had to wait 50 minutes - 1 hour - even just for a drink and plate of nuts.  On every occasion the person who took my order told me the order would take 20 - 30 minutes.    Finally, the day of my departure I had checked out, paid and"
2063,"I stayed for 3 nights in the month of  May, 15.  This is a marvellous hotel, very well connected and centrally located.  The decor is very beautiful and service is excellent. The rooms on the higher floor with sea views are recommended.  Staff team is very helpful. Food is also good.  It's upto the mark OF JWM"
2064,"This hotel is especially recommended for its staff. They do their utmost to make your stay as pleasant as possible. We were in an executive room on the fourth floor with complementary access to the Executive Lounge. Breakfast, high-tea, drinks and small food items were great. The in-house restaurants are also great options, with a wide choice in cuisine and price level from medium to high. We ate at the Indian restaurant Safron and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner experience there. Still, although a JW Marriott, better to lower your expectations somewhat. The experience is not that of a top five star hotel if it comes to the infrastructure and some management issues. The shared areas of the hotel and garden / pool show some wear and tear and designs are a bit outdated. Not real"
2065,"This property has taken care of every need of a business traveler. The in room amenities are well though of and appropriate. The comfort level of the bed and the access to switches, close curtains etc was great. I loved the face mirror, it was the best I have seen.  I could make a suggestion, every hotel has their own type of shower system. A small instruction near the sink of how to use the the knobs etc would be helpful. It took time to figure, and got wet again when i tried to stop the drip from the smaller shower. The bath was very relaxing.  Breakfast was good, with a wide choice. In room dining prompt and food very good."
2066,"Positive: Great and impressive entrance hall. Nice pool area. Good and comfortably rooms. Easy and quick check inn. Very friendly service. Good and comfortable Executive Lounge. Airport shuttle without any problems . Ideal for business stay. Negative: Dirty Beach as well as water. Check out takes too long. Absolutely unacceptable costs for WLAN. A 5 Star -Hotel has to provide cost free WLAN especially if they are charge rates like JW Marriott Mumbai.  All in all an acceptable 5 Star Hotel, but with room for improvement."
2067,"Very accommodating. The rooms as usual were extremely good, something which you expect of JW Marriott! Loved the food, the location is quite excellent too! Something special about this place i fell always when i go there!"
2068,"I went there today to do a booking (with full payment) for my relative (as I wanted to gift them a Honeymoon Package). The booking ordeal lasted for 1 hour 20 minutes.   If the front desk of a hotel is the face of the entire hotel's hospitality, then this hotel will have the rudest, most indifferent personnel in the entire hospitality industry.  Even if you stand at the front desk, ready to pay in full for the advance reservation, they will still ask you to talk on phone to reservation, who will put you on hold as all executives are busy.  After I gave them my entire requirement, they made me wait for more then an hour to start the booking process. Plus, the front desk and the reservation phone person, both gave me different details regarding the package that I wanted to book."
2069,"Booked this hotel for a birthday treat for my family , We loved the room, everything you could need was there, excellent location and a very wide range of food offered at dinner , From the moment we walked in the door, we knew we were someplace special , I cannot imagine a more accommodating place to stay , we had so much fun on my birthday , its always felt good to visit JW MARRIOTT ."
2070,"Recently stayed at the JW Marriott in Juhu for close to a week on business.  It was my second stay at the hotel.  The staff were consistently asking what more they could do.  A special shout out to the amazing staff and chefs in the main restaurant.  I am absolutely sure each and every one of them checked in with me at every meal.  They are attentive, kind, friendly and look to exceed expectations at every step.  They even prepared a special tasting for me my last night and sent me off with a gift.  My only issue was that after being with the hotel for 5 nights, my flight leaving was in the evening.  I checked out in the am and they kindly kept my bags safe.  When I returned for dinner before going to the airport, it was challenging (and ultimately impossible) to extend my free"
2071,"I have gone there three times already for different events and the food is nice but not that great, They have very very good service, with a good variety of drinks and snacks, very good hotel to have cooperate events"
2072,"I stayed here for 8 days in the summer of 2014. The staff is quite friendly and the property is well built... open spacious buffet area with LOTS of natural light coming in with LARGE Bay windows (I think extending beyond 4 floors!)  The nursery / play room - this is one hotel where they have a nanny on duty in the play room (Thankfully!) Such a boon for working moms. Very friendly and motherly lady on duty during our stay there. She played with my son and offered to take care of him all by herself if we wanted to have a quite meal (my son was less than a year old and is very active and loud). After staying at JW, I often find myself recommending to other business hotels to have a similar set-up. Isn't this a world where we should encourage working moms to travel with their"
2073,"I can only think of one negative about this hotel - it's a bit too crowded, particularly at weekends. But then, a great number of visitors is mostly a testament to its quality.  It's in Mumbai, but its beach-side setting gives it a much different feel from the rest of the city. It's more relaxed, the air is cooler and the neighbourhood is less noisy than elsewhere. Moreover, the swimming pool is quite good (and large), making it a good choice for a weekend of de-stress for those who live in Mumbai. It also has good restaurants - apart from Arola, which in my visits there wasn't up to standard.  A suggestion is to pay a bit more for an executive suite. You then have access to the lounge, where you can have food and drinks (including alcohol) at any time of the day.  And a quick"
2074,I recently visited Mumbai on a short trip and stayed at J W Marriott. The rooms were average but i loved the hospitality that was showered on us. Nice dinner at Saffron and sumptuous breakfast in the morning at lotus cafe. Special thanks to Pramod and the restaurant manager for the extra care and comfort.
2075,"After just completing a 10-day stay for business, this beach-side hotel has launched itself toward the top of the rather long list of business accommodations at which I have stayed through the years. The facilities are fantastic, the location is quite nice and the rooms are beyond adequate. The restaurants are also standout. The prices are not cheap but this place is worth every penny. However, having said that, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize that the salient feature of this hotel is the wonderful service offered by a well-trained and hospitable staff. I was addressed by name throughout my stay by more staff members than I could have imagined should have known who I was. That counts for a lot.  I was visiting my distributor for activities in India over a two-week"
2076,"So my wife and I decided to check In for a couple of nights over the weekend... Great check in, we were booked to stay in the executive floor, I had heard that the rooms were small in this hotel so at check in asked for a bigger room which was duly provided.   The lounge had great food and wine/ liquor selections through the evening never seen something like this.   Restaurants were empty on a Friday night which seemed odd... Food was unfortunately not authentic ordered a chicken clay pot which is a Chinese dish and was completely Thai tasting with basil leaves. Please ensure food is ""Authentic"" as advertised.   One thing that was honestly tacky was a 100 rupee charge for room Service delivery very tacky from a 5 star hotel, left a bad taste in my mouth.   Great pool, great view"
2077,"All the rooms come with complimentary fresh fruits, coffee and tea making. best room service. restaurants and bars sections is excellent beautiful rooms one of the best Executive Lounge supper staff supper place"
2078,"As you enter the hotel, you are impressed by the lobby, which is nice, clean and big. The room was well furnished. Facing the Juhu Beach, a lot of rooms give excellent view of the Arabian Sea.  Food at lotus cafe was tasty, but the service and attention to individual needs require attention. A little mismanaged. Excellent hotel, but require some improvement in giving personal touch."
2079,"Although we've only stayed at the JW Marriot in Juhu twice, we are practically there everyday as members of the Quan Spa and health club facilities. We live not far from the hotel and find the general ambience of the place to be both warm and efficient. We frequently eat at the 4 restaurants though our favourite is the BBC, their ever popular bakery/cafe. The relatively new lounge Arola is comparable to any international one. The best feature of the Marriot is its staff, they are always warm, ever welcoming and helpful. The worst I would say is the fact that their coffee shop Lotus cafe is very badly ventilated and tends to stink up the whole lobby area particularly when they have grilled or fried fish on the menu."
2080,"This is the best hotel till date which i have visited and has a very good and wide varieties in terms of rooms, Food (Break fast, Lunch and Dinner).  The pool , In room Wifi, Staff , Payment - No words to express to rate these, Simply superb."
2081,The hotel is simply world Class n the hospitality is one of the best ive seen ....  The restaurants inside the hotel has a class of its own n the buffet has a lovely variety of intercontinental food .... All in all it's a wonderful hotel to spend some quality time with ur loved ones üëç
2082,"I chose this hotel, since it was a wedding visit of a close relative.  I Loved the ambience and the staff were very polite. Its an amazing place! At any time of the hour, we would get food delivered to our room. I would definitely want to visit JW Marriott Hotel again!"
2083,SUPER staff super place food is amazing the best spread for breakfast and people working are so hospitable and kind . the best hotel i have lived in .... and would continue living ..... again and again
2084,"Loved the experiences. Stayed here for 2 nights with friends. Excellent hotel overall, and easy to get around, especially if you have come for shopping. I give this hotel a 5 out of 5! Great staff, beautiful rooms, one of the best Executive Lounges ever inclusive of a chef in the morning"
2085,"I have been charged illegally on my credit card given at the time of my stay at your Jw marriot hotel in Mumbai, I was staying in the hotel property from 2nd april 2015to 5th april 2014 and at the time of check out I was presented with a wrong bill, I wa posted by some bills from poolside and restaurants which was not signed by me and by some fellow travellers on my room number, which was never confirmed by me, I denied to pay those charges at the time of check out and rest aid my entire bill amount of 5200/- approximately, I asked  the hotel front desk (Mr. Gaurav) to produce the bill and as to my shock some one had signed it in my room number with an over handwriting which I do not know if any hotel employee could have done, inspite of me missing my flight back to Delhi I"
2086,"I have checked in last month, the reception counter and baggage holder are work so professional. I impressed with the hotel Room is so amazing and clean neat fantastic. location is comfortable to go to marker and restaurant nearby"
2087,"The check in was not so great, no one asked why we were visiting, if we needed any suggestions of what to do etc when I asked concierge what there was to do he was not very knowledgable or enthusiastic about giving me any answers.   On the other hand, the restaurant staff were amazing! Especially during breakfast! Special mention for the waiter Eliseus for attending to our every need and going above and beyond what is expected of him and also to chef Nishad who took extra special care of my family and I and came to greet us every morning. They really made our trip special and added on a personal touch so a big thank you to them!   We will be back for sure! Thanks to your breakfast staff :)"
2088,"Stayed here for 2 nights with friends. Excellent hotel overall, and easy to get around, especially if you have come for shopping. Many restaurants nearby as well as great food at the hotel itself. Great customer service. Will definitely stay here on my next trip to India."
2089,"I give this hotel a 5 out of 5! Great staff, beautiful rooms, one of the best Executive Lounges ever inclusive of a chef in the morning and evening to cook food and an open bar! Food quality was excellent, service was excellent, location was great, I am so happy I stayed here and not at the Taj. Minor comments would be towards the Concierge. We had challenges getting a good Concierge for advice. Each person at the desk told us something different. Our first day we asked about seeing a show or a tour and we were handed a brochure and told to find something. Then we asked about an English speaking show, we were told there was one and when we asked if they know the story line, we were told ""no."" I think for such a nice hotel, they should get their Concierge staff consistent as this"
2090,"Great location , right in front of famous Juhu beach, reasonable distance from both domestic and international airport, gorgeous architecture,  Big , beautiful lobby , huge dinning area , delicious food ,  all those amenities , one would look forward to have in stae hotel , all above points convert into a memorable stay ,"
2091,"The hotel is quite old , need lots of work with respect to maintenance and interiors , staff courtesy level needs work specially at hotel welcome areas starting from entry gate and specially front office,my check in and check ou experience was both average nothing like a JW should be , no assistance with luggage offered , rooms corridors smell old , as mentioned the hotel interiors needs serious works ,   Buffet b fast was fine , I would say food quality and variatey would be 6/10 , staff service was better here than front office and other areas .  That have a good spa  and good therapists , gym is good as well.   Pls check call rates before u pick up n decide to make local call from your room , because the hotel has upsurd prices for a local call , they charge you 110 rupees"
2092,"lavish breakfast, comfort stays and Amazing lounge experience on the snacks and drinks. Room sizes are adequaete with modern infra and comfortable nose level to stay. Lounges are good snacks serving with drink menu. Overall a good property to stay on"
2093,"Loved it, gorgeous hotel - first class, perfect location, staff amazing, the food delicious - everything was marvelous.   The Marriott shall be remembered for its beauty and splendor, but also for its humanity and customer care, at least in my book. Marriott's are top notch hotels, there is no doubt about it - this one did not disappoint. My bed was the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in.  Views were amazing and they gave me one of the pool and beach rooms. From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel welcome and special.   The staff is very well trained here and the hotel managed perfectly."
2094,"The hotel is situated on the Juhu Beach and is approximately 20-25 minutes drive from the domestic airport. The check in process was a bit slow even when I was the only person on the check in counter. There was no one to carry your luggage and to guide to your room. One has to carry your own luggage. I had only one piece of luggage so it was not a problem. The lobby is huge and inviting and gives you a view of the restaurant, swimming pool, and the sea beyond. There is a lot of space for visitors to relax in the lobby. I had a room on the fifth floor with a view of the sea. The room was fairly small but that is what one expects in Mumbai hotels. It had all the amenities including a tea/coffee maker. The wash basin is outside the toilet so is convenient if two persons stay in the"
2095,"Marriot !!!! If any one wants to know it ome word i would simply say its Awesome.. My first visit to this hotel was for my close  friends weddings. I was simplg amazed by the service they provided. Food superb. Service superb. Ambience superb. The view from the hotel apartment is lovely . Decoration , mandap set up , food  everything was indeed admirable. very nice place for functions!!"
2096,"Visited Bombay in Feb and stayed at the Marriott, what a fabulous stay it was! The hotel is gorgeous and the staff is superb! They were attentive to every need and made sure our stay was super comfortable. The buffet breakfast was delicious! Will definitely be back here soon!"
2097,"Awesome Experience, Well built property. Luxury at its best. Well trained staffs, food quality and presentation excellent. Value for money. Perfect location near to airport. A leisure dinner recommended."
2098,"The hotel is located in the happening area of the city, beautiful view, very good service.   1. Entering the hotel - JW is very cautious towards safety of its guests and due to some terrorist activities in the past in Mumbai the hotel checks each and every vehicle entering its premises so you need to have patience. After vehicle is cleared then you and your belongings need to pass through x-ray machine and metal detectors. It would take at least 10-20 mins to enter the hotel lobby after all the security. 2. Lobby - lobby is huge and beautiful, you can see the back of the hotel from lobby. Reception is big and with a lot of staff. They took some time to check us in but were very polite and professional. 3. Going to room - at least I saw elevators only on one side of the hotel so"
2099,"I visited Mumbai on Jan during that period I was staying there. The hotel room was very clean and tidy. Beach view room, very friendly staff, wonderful food. It was expensive but worth for the money. The only problem I had was wifi. 3G was very fast compared to wifi.  Friends stayed other rooms wasn't having a wifi problem. Overall, good experience, wonderful stay for stag party. Thanks Guys."
2100,"really impressed with this hotel. excellent service and lovely food. marriott's aren't my favourite chain but i've been very impressed with them all lately. this hotel is right on the beach with a great pool (which i haven't used to be fair - the beach or the pool).  breakfast is immense. the best i've ever had by a long way. fresh, delicious, lots of choice. just superb.  location is good for me but may not be to everyone's taste but mumbai is so  big that you can't stay anywhere close to everything."
2101,"it depends on individual choice for the location when you are in mumbai. When you are working in the south of Bombay but have friends and family living in sub Urbans, I suggest you go for Juhu Mariott.   It not only gives you the best views but easy check in and check out through your phone. Actually, that's only if you become a member with mariott group and download the app. I suggest you must.    All in all five starsüí´"
2102,"i stayed from 23rd april for 2 nights this year this was my 2nd stay i would still rate it the best 5 star property in terms of location & lively atmosphere but definitely the quality of service has gone down a bit since my last stay in 2014 this does not mean the quality was sub standard or bad but not as superlative as i had experienced in april 2014 (the reason for me repeating my stay this year was the excellent service i had received in april 2014) this time i felt as if there was a kind of austerity instructions that the staff had as they were not as lavish & indulgent as last year - this one could make out from small things like the fruits in the basket etc. another point, you can not have all your meals at the lotus cafe unless you want to get bored with monotony i love"
2103,"Stayed here for 4 nights on two separate occasions. There are a lot of platinum members so don't expect a huge upgrade, but the staff does try. The rooms a nice and adequate. The executive lounge is great and offers items throughout the day. The pool area is nice, but no alcohol served. If you need to be in the area, you will be quite pleased to stay here. The restaurants are quite nice."
2104,"Wehad the most amazing stay at this hotel. The staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. Upon arrival the duty manager Viny was most accommodating. We booked three club rooms and unbeknown to me none was sea facing rooms , Viny was great and gave us a room that was sea facing. her pleasnt smile and cheer made for an excellent start to our stay. The buffet dinner was out of this world. My kids and fianc√© were bursting at the seam. Breakfast was super amazing. The catering/dining staff was most amazing,always smiling and always pleasant.  My children were so impressed that they did not want to leave the hotel and go out. The cherry on the top was that our flight back to South Africa was around 9pm, the evening duty manager was more than gracious and allowed us one"
2105,"I didn't stay at JW Marriott but as Went there a couple of times during my stay in mumbai. Great location and ambience. Professional and friendly staff, great swimming pool and spa and amazing food. Plus you could purchase a specialty chocolate there which is divine! All in all I had a wonderful experience."
2106,"Excellent property, awesome view & location. Clean room & professional & friendly staff. Room service was quick enough, food was excellent. Got early check in which is a very good customer service which I liked the most."
2107,great hospitality. amazing hotel.nice rooms.good food. great staff.situated in heart of the city i.e. juhu. nice swimming pool area. very nice breakfast..wifi is free if you are member of marriott hotels.
2108,"Debated whether to give this a 3 or 4 out of 5. Gave the benefit of the doubt with a 4 in the end due to its location but in truth there are many improvements required - club lounge and service very average, food distinctly unimpressive and decor (despite recent refurb) seems outdated. Still a nice hotel but pretty expensive for what you get."
2109,"Staying at a JWM you expect top quality and this hotel did not disappoint. Right from the airport pick up in a range rover sport until check out, it was an outstanding stay! The hotel is an old property but excellently maintained. My room was well designed giving a spacious feel. Breakfast was a big spread with a wide variety of choices. The staff were very courtious and extremely accommodating. The location itself is great, overlooking the Arabian sea and there are plenty of choices for food around and within 5-7 mins walk."
2110,"I last visited this hotel in September 2014 and noted a significant decline in service from previous visits.  When I returned this April, I was pleasantly surprised as the hotel has once again risen to 5 Star standards.  The service was caring and impeccable right from the moment I entered until the time I left. Of special note, beside the comfortable rooms and resort-like pool area, was the check in attendant Sief and the Chef de Cuisine, Nishad Sebastien.  Chef Sebastien went out of his way both times I was in the Lotus Cafe to ensure my experience and food was outstanding.  I cannot say enough good things about this property, so if you get a chance to visit please do."
2111,"great food, wonderful ambience. loved the buffet at lotus cafe. rooms are very comfortable and cozy. the spa expperience at the hotel was awesome too. friendly and helpful staff. great place to unwind and chill over the weekend with family"
2112,"Its hard to imagine a Hotel that claims to be 5-Star but that does not offer Free Wi-Fi in today's day and age. To top it up, the service is very poor. I have encountered far better sleep quality, overall service and total stay experience at Business Hotels. At Rs. 20000 a night, this just isn't worth it. Go for Novotel nearby, better value ..."
2113,Throughout the stay I thought almost everything was very high quality. The rooms are nice and posh tho a bit small. Lobby and pool are magnificent. Breakfast I thought was below par and choice of bread was mainly limited to sweet ones and service was very ordinary. Also the concierge /bell desk was unhelpful. Akanksha now in front office was smart and sharp and helpful. Overall its a great property and has a nice resort feel.
2114,"The staff of the hotel are very professional and prompt and they like helping you in every way possible. The view is amazing, room are great a good and luxurious stay in mumbai.  I will recommend people who are there for business or solo trips to stay at this hotel as it is very near to the airpot and has the facilities one needs."
2115,Visited the JW Marriott Juhu after a couple of years. Was pleasantly surprised right from the hotels email follow up pre check in until a pleasant check out by Wasim.  Khusboo emailled me pre check in to inquire of any requirements i would have regarding the room or any other assistanc needed. She was amazing at ensuring every thing was a requested and even went ahead with a room upgrade to my choice. Normally a 1 room category is expected for elite members. She went out of her way to pleasantly surprise us with a higer than expected upgrade.   The reception staff was very prompt in the process of check in. The team at the executive lounge was very professional and prompt. They went out of the way and set new standards of hospitality.  The staff at the lotus cafe were a bit slow
2116,"Nice staff, great ambiance. They wont provide the free internet facility in the rooms. and the charges of the hi speed is bit high. Overall we had a great experience and loved being there. Food is also good"
2117,"Excellent place, match less food, exotic location, amneties. 5 Star for all criteria. Very near from Airport, at Juhu beach. Up to date Gym, Swimming pool, garden. All amneties awarded as 7 Star. Do visit."
2118,Pros - great pool area and lots of greenery - friendly reception and security staff - restaurant buffet is extensive and service prompt - rooms are slightly small but very well decorated. Bathroom marble looks fabulous  Cons - quite expensive compared to other 5 stars. - strange fish smell in the reception on 1 of the nights we were staying
2119,I stayed at Marriot with my cousin who was visiting from London. This was by far one of the best experiences I had stay-wise in any five star hotel. The rooms are plush and cosy. The beds are amazing. The best part is the sound proofing in the rooms. You can't hear outside noice or chatter and once inside there's a pin drop silence. The bathrooms are good size. This is a great place if you want just escape the outside world and take a break even if you are from Mumbai! Highly recommended.
2120,"The Place to be !!! Great HOTEL, wonderful service, outstanding dedication of the service team. Thank you for an excellent stay I was fortunate to spend nearly 4 nights at JW marriott hotel.  The service was top class, the facilities high quality and the food delicious and with a wide selection. The gym and pool were completed during my stay and I enjoyed their view. Thank you for your hospitality I will come again.‚Äù"
2121,"I have been to the Marriot a number of times and always have had a very good experience. Be it the food, the ambience, the crowd, the service, always been very good, Definitely recommend to anyone visiting here"
2122,"Great Hotel.. Lovely view of the beach from the lobby and the pool side. The feel of Bali in Mumbai...:-)  I Love all the restaurants - Spices, Mezzo Mezzo, Lotus cafe has a great buffet. My favourite is BBC and the bakery there...ANd of course, the best dessert buffet in town!!"
2123,This place is simply heaven. My visa was expiring and I had a 12 hour wait for my plane. I went simply to have lunch by the pool and wait in an area close to to airport. From the moment I arrived I was treated like royalty. In spite of the fact that I had just traveled from the south of Indian and looked more like aa desert rat than a hotel quest. I asked if I could use the facilities while I waited and the manager actually put me in a room so I could bathe and rest. Every detail of this hotel was perfect. If the currect manager stays on I am sure they will succeed in the best possible way.
2124,"We stayed 1 night at thos hotel in a twin room on a package deal. The reception on arrival was welcoming and the room we were given had a nice view.  The room itself as quite small but the twin beds were double beds and extremely confy. The shower facilities were excellent.  The pool area is really nice, clean and well maintained. The only criticism of this area is the lack of food & beverage you can order.  We had a buffet for both dinner and breakfast. Both had a good selection of food and the staff were friendly and helpful. In terms of eating at this hotel it is very restricted at lunch times as the other restaurants only open at night time. The bar does not open until 4pm and doesnt have the best atnosphere.  I would recommend a stay at this hotel as it is lovely and has a"
2125,"Marriott lives upto its expectation with the best facilities. The hotel overall is very spacious and well maintained, but the rooms feel like they are a little small and the TV sucks. Their gym and pool is second to none. Also, there are many dining options with the buffet being my favorite. The in-room dining options are again very limited. So in short, if you don't stay in your room(stay in beach or pool or even lobby :p) long then this is the place to stay."
2126,"It is a very convenient hotel for both business & holiday short stays in busy Mumbai city. Time taken to commute from & to airport is only 20-30 minutes even day time or night.   Located on the Juhu beach, overlooking the scenic waters of the Arabian Sea and guest could walk to beach from hotel easily. Although the beach view is very pleasant from the hotel room, it is not so nice when you are there as it is always very crowded. Free WIFI in the room and also lobby area easily accessible & works well. Coffee shop restaurant has good spread for breakfast, lunch and dinner which provides very friendly & personalize service. If you are interested in  authentic Indian cuisines, Saffron is the place to have. Front office staff is very friendly & helpful. Overall it is a very nice"
2127,"Stayed in JW mid March. The whole experience was suburb, from being picked up in  Range Rover, to the location of the room overlooking the sea on the fifth floor, to the delicious breakfast buffet every morning. The staff at JW were accommodating, flexible and went out of their way to suggest restaurants, tour guides and money exchanging tips. ( if you have a large amount to change, ask them for the local bank rate, its higher and they will delver). The pool was nice but my best experience was to walk along Juhu beach,  though the back of the hotel before 8am, when all the locals were out, playing football and cricket or generally walking. Only one thing that the staff should review and that is to write down client requests, which they were going to follow up on. A couple of"
2128,"Yes, Its a property which I would like to recommend to people to stay at when on a trip to Mumbai. Have heard their regular rooms are a little small but the suites are just great . All amenities are well appointed and staff is also truly hospitable !!"
2129,"I stayed at the Marriott in Mumbai for 8 days in March for a business trip, and it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. After a 15 hour flight the staff did everything possible to make sure we were comfortable, from bringing flowers to my room to dealing with my nut allergy expertly. The room was modern, with a bed that was like sleeping in a cloud. The shower was perfect for washing the jetlag away, and the view of the sun setting over the Arabian Sea from the pool area was the icing on the cake. Everything in Mumbai seems to be measured in time rather than in distance, so it took us on average 35 minutes to get to work each morning at Hypercity and 90 minutes to travel to the Gateway of India. On the final day we were celebrating Holi Festival so I had my 'do not"
2130,"Last week I had the distinct pleasure of staying at this superb hotel for business.My stay was absolutely perfect, besides a few hitches with the front desk staff. From the kind,courteous and professional staff, to the meticulous, comfortable room and common areas, gym, the business centre, restaurants and buffet breakfast my experience was nothing less than exceptional."
2131,"luxurious, well serviced, variety of gastronomic privileges. Just the pool aint so deep. its in a well heeled suburb. the glorious arabian sea. the mix of people at the hotel. the sunsets. all good! my fav is their restaurant mezzo mezzo. they ve global standards!"
2132,"My Wife stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights in Feb. Hotel was chosen at we had previously stayed here and were very impressed. JW Marriott did not let us down this time too. Breakfast is top quality with a wide range to choose from and rooms are decent quality. Staff are very helpfull, I was unable to make the trip, but wanted to arrange a small gift for wife whilst she stayed at the hotel over Valentines day. I emailed the General Manager, Pavithran Nambiar and he responded back to my email promptly and arranged for a bouquet of flowers and a cake for her......won't hesitate to stay here again during the next trip."
2133,"This hotel is facing the Juhu beach. So breakfast and dinner with an awesome view. The staff also tried to provide 5 star service and were all attentive.  I am especially impressed with their wake up call. I somehow woke up earlier and went for early breakfast. I found hotel staff outside of my room, knocking , to  wake me up.  This is after they tried calling me and when I did not pick up the phone, they went up to 4th floor to my room to make sure to wake me up. Awesome service - I really appreciate that.  This is so important for business traveller suffering from jetlag :) Food was awesome.  Hotel grounds clean and beautiful.  I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and business associates."
2134,"We stayed at the Royal Lotus Suite which has a mesmerizing view of the beach and the sea. The room service and housekeeping was perfect. The hotel staff was courteous, efficient and always ready to help. Breakfast at the Lotus Caf√© was an elaborate spread of freshly prepared dishes, and we were actually spoilt for choices! Chef Mehta and Chef Nishad pampered the kids with light and fluffy Micky Mouse-shaped pancakes, and tempting waffles.  We really liked the swimming pools, the kids‚Äô water slide and the easy access to the beach from the hotel. The Executive Lounge was the perfect way to unwind after a long day- an awesome view, relaxing ambience, and off course scrumptious food and drinks served by an extremely efficient staff. Mr Joydeep and Mr Amir made sure that we were well"
2135,"It is one classy property on the sea beach in Juhu, The beach experience is mesmeric and the Lotus Cafe experience adequate. I love the piano on the portico. The food and beverage sections are ample and the night club (Enigma) a hot spot."
2136,"The staff made all the difference!  Everyone was so attentive and showed a genuine interest in helping us feel at  home.    We ate at 3 of the restaurants at the JW and I must say food was succulent well deserving of their awards.     The interior of the hotel is beautiful and the rooms were spacious and immaculate.   We were on the 4th flour  right above the pool with  an incredible view of the ocean.  The exterior of the hotel does need a little cleaning as does the beach even if it‚Äôs not JW‚Äôs private beach, only  reason why it doesn't get 5 stars.  My friends and I had a wonderful time and we definitely recommend this hotel."
2137,We had taken up room on 2nd floor with an excellent ocean view.. There is back door which opens into the Juhu beach..  It is not a private beach so it was pretty dirty and we didnt spend much time there.. The location of the hotel makes it really special.. the hotel service is great and buffet is amazing.. The hotel staff was really helpful..
2138,Stay was pleasant however checkin process and service levels need to be beefed up.  Executive lounge does have a good ambience.  Breakfast has a good spread and is quite efficient if you are short of time.
2139,"Hi, Actually i didn't stayed in this hotel but visited to meet my brother. However, during my stay of 3-4 hours experienced this hotel. It is very neat and clean, near to Juhu beach. Food is very yummy and most of the time waiters are continuously helping you to select the cuisines and they are also keen to know that whatever they served was tasty or not. 5 Star rating to this hotel."
2140,"Excellent Stay At JW , Superbly done rooms , next to the beach , excllent service and food quality , staff is ever friendly , very easy check in and out , superb sleep quality and quiet surroundings in the morning , would always go back."
2141,"I like the usual Marriott experience, this wasn't that great. I found the staff a little lost and confused, with too much back and forth. Rooms are fine (usual five star contemporary)  the pool side is very fancy."
2142,"Stayed here for 3 nights including New Years Eve, and it was very disappointing. Staff felt unfriendly. Restaurant food wasn't great either. However, rooms were excellent.  For NYE, the hotel was disappointing. More of a business than a family hotel."
2143,"They have the most amazing buffet spead  at the lotus cafe. The salmon , prawns are very fresh. The rooms at the hotel are very small and room service too is just about ok. The food at all the restaurants is simply amazing . The tuna sandwich at bombay baking company is ideal for the  health conscious"
2144,"Stayed here for 2 nights in March and had a great experience. The ambiance, pool areas, restaurants, beach etc. are amazing and probably some of the best in Mumbai. This was my second stay here after 7 years and noticed the rooms were renovated, comfortable, clean, modern and upscale.  The hotel is safe and security checks all vehicles and bags. Room service and laundry is also good and at a fair price. The hotel is also located in Juhu right on the beach with beach access. The area is very nice with lots to do. The only drawback is if you need to get to the ‚Äútown‚Äù part of Mumbai it can take some time in traffic. Our package included massages and breakfast buffet. The massages were nice but the ambiance of the spa could be better. The breakfast was luxurious and grand."
2145,"I checked in around 10.30 at night on a Thursday. The check in process took more than 35 minutes...The front desk staff was scarce and looked confused. I had an early day the next day and wasting my precious time like this at check in was a real put off. The next morning at breakfast it was a madhouse. There was no place to sit. The breakfast area looked and sounded like a fish market. There were people waiting to be seated and after a wait I was given a table almost outside of the breakfast area in a dingy corner. The buffet was very good but the ambience made it very difficult to enjoy anything. I have stayed in this property before but have not had this sort of an experience. The only thing I can conclude from here is that due to their popularity, they are getting more"
2146,"Good place & wonderful service, I prefer this as at least when back from office, you can walk upto Beach and relax. I like their Italian restaurant. Though beds could be made a little more comfortable, ITC is good in that segment. Internet - WiFi is really good speed & seamless connectivity. Pool is really good. Breakfast spread is very neat.  Recommend to stay."
2147,"visited friends last week visiting the city. Before arriving i called in to speak to my friends in their hotel, the tel operator (male) had an accent that even the Scottish wudn't understand, leave alone American/English & we fellow indians... not even in the list. what use is the accent when not a single word is understood, except "" JW Marriott"" in the whole sentence. I requested to repeat what he said becoz i didnt quite understand what he meant me to do... but he hung up. Called up again... same guy picks up... requested him directly to put me on to my guest in the respective room number.... He hung up. (or was it the MTNL exchange playing the prank). Third time - got lucky - another tel operator took the message n the needful was done.   Meeting the guests in the lobby is a"
2148,"I stayed at this hotel in the last week of Feb 2015 for two nights. Having stayed at many other hotels, one thing that clearly stood out to me is that the staff here is not as welcoming and courteous as one would expect from a 5 star Hotel!.   Here are a few observations (some of these concerns are more serious than the others) - The folks at front-desk were very cold and I found that a bit unwelcoming.   - The bell desk did not offer to get my luggage to my room.   Here is the worst experience of all: - The front-desk told me that the Internet would be free if I register for Marriot rewards membership and they gave me a card with my member number (I forgot what number it is). After going to the room, I tried connecting to the internet and it would only show me ""paid options"""
2149,"Excellent car service from/to airport. Staff very warm and accommodating throughout stay. Enjoyed as a gold member free Wi-Fi, lounge access and breakfast. breakfast was excellent. Lounge had good snacks and beverages. Overall really enjoyed the service and hotel."
2150,"Had Coffee with Wife & Friends at around 1 AM ! It was great, Ambiance was up to the Mark and the Sitting area near pool, was quite good and calm. Food though a bit expensive, which is ought to be, being a 5 Star Property, but ok for a few times !"
2151,Have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and this was a major disappointment for what was meant to be a 5 star hotel. In brief here are some of Pluses and negatives  Negatives 1. Deluxe Rooms have a very weird bathroom setup which has no privacy. Sliding doors to enclose the bathroom area. 2. Rooms were dirty with floor and sofa filthy. 3. Towels did not look clean 4. Fruit was not edible 5. only one bathrobe 6. Room next to a roof which had hundreds of pigeons making noise all day. 7. Bar service at poolside excuciatingly slow. We were the only ones by the pool at 11am but our Mocktails took 25 minutes to come. 8. No Alcohol at the pool side ? 9. Pools still being cleaned at 11am ? 10. Spices lounge food was terrible 11. Chicken Chat was raw twice 12. Taxi to airport
2152,"Celebrated Dhuleti at the Marriott. Went with family and friends. The hotel organised it near the small swimming pool next to the main swimming pool. Hotel provided colours, music,  drinks and food, all of good quality at reasonable cost. Nice experience. Due to loud volume and nature of party, not good for small children."
2153,"what an experience this business luxury hotel gave me. Amazing location, near the juhu neach and the airport. Such a grand welcome, in contour with the hotel size. Great staff, great rooms, great food. Thumbs up. Must for luxury business travellers in mumbai."
2154,"Location is practical, situated is one of the most Posh location of Mumbai. Overlooking the sea. Has the best pool i have ever seen in my life...Arola and Lotus Cafe are also good restuarants within their premises and this hotel always spots bollywood celebrities!"
2155,"Can one ever have any bad or even an average experience at this property? JW Marriott at Juhu, Mumbai had always been one of the most famous and premium properties in town. The location, ambiance, property in itself, staff, hospitality, food etc. etc. is incomparable. I stayed for one night at this property and loved every bit of my time spent at the hotel. The view from the room is mesmerizing. overlooking the Arabian sea. The view of the pool from the room is simply amazing. The service is very prompt. I had trouble with the electronics in the room, and staff was very helpful in immediately addressing the issue and replacing the defective with the spares. I am surely coming back to this property."
2156,"you have everything inhouse, amazing food buffet, ala carte menus, swimming pool amazing site. best board room for meetings, marriage functions, lots of parkings, centrally located in mumbai, the international and domestic airports are very near from the hotel."
2157,"It's always so delightful to enjoy the culinary experience at the JW marriott, not only is the food awesome but the staff is extremely friendly and courteous.... Sous Chef Dvipal Mehta is fantastic and is always willing to accommodate .... Thank you, Debra Chapman.... A loyal member of Marriott hotels."
2158,"The standard of rooms is very disappointing and surprisingly a hotel with 355 rooms has only 2 fans to provide to its guests. The duty manager at the time, Shanawaz  Sheikh, was rude and is not fit to hold the position of a duty manager. After periodically/repeatedly calling for assistance none was provided and the room temperature stayed at 21 degrees. The engineer did come, twice, but was clueless and did nothing.Though someone did come up to show us another room, the temperature was just as hot. The complaint against Mr Sheikh is not on lack of effort, but after a sleepless warm night the last thing you want to hear from a duty manager is that he would treat you better, but you are there on a discounted rate. This was said to my husband at 6 am after paying extra for an"
2159,Went to their coffee shop Lotus Cafe.....!!!!Just when you enter to the staircase itself you get the hint of the excellent ambience they have....!!!! Beautifully designed restaurant..... Excellent food... Especially the Classic Ceasar Salad n their hand tossed pizza....!!! The best part is that you can always customize your pizza they way you want n they'll serve you with a smile....!!!!Excellent food.... Excellent services n last but not the least the royal ambience they have......!!!!!! Keep it up guys.....!!!!
2160,Overall experience of visit of j w Mumbai was excellent..specially bbc restaurant was d center of attattraction for cake lover lyk me...service over bbc was totally delightful .abience was superb ..n taste was excellent !!!! Eagerly waiting to visit bbc again.... T y bbc guys for ua special efforts..
2161,"Superb hospitality and excellent stay! the food and the buffet was awesome, the pool side and pool was clean with great view of the beach. the beach access was great and the best part was the service!"
2162,JW marriott Juhu hotel is having very good location and had an amazing experience. The View from the Resturant  is worth it along with the very good service followed with swimming pool just next to beach. Thanks for outstanding Service.
2163,"Recently visited the Lotus cafe a 24/7 restaurant with a  awesome view....Juhu beach is behind this hotel...lovely ambience....the lotus cafe staff are also so warm, helpful and always smiling...Cheers"
2164,I love to have coffee in their Lotus restaurant during evenings. have been to this place many times. a well maintained 5 star property where bollywood starts frequent. the hotel is connected to Juhu beach.
2165,"J W marriott is a very nice hotel. Food is not to be good but service  is outstanding. In lotus cafe,I am coming for holi branch is very nice. I am coming next time also In marriott  an lotus cafe as well. Thanks for outstanding service."
2166,"I had been to marriott just last month with my friends...and I must say that the breakfast area Lotus cafe is the best restaurant...they have such a huge spread of breakfast that you wont know from where to start off...the lotus cafe staff are also so warm, helpful and always smiling....Way to go Lotus cafe..."
2167,"The New Sahar Location was just opening up. Spent two nights as a business traveler. Excellent service, very courteous staff and HUGE rooms. Very well located  - close to domestic airport and shouting distance from the New International Terminal. The rooms are really cool and I got a view that allowed us to see the flights taking off -but remarkably silent. Room facilities are great. The restaurant - Romanos - serves great continental fare (was what we tried). The conference halls are great and facilities as good as expected. The breakfast buffet is fantastic - though you might have to walk a bit as it is pread over a very large dining area. Staff will also do tableside service.  Over all - great experience. 7 star."
2168,"stayed with family from 16 to 21 Feb 2015. Everyone from doormen to reception staff so welcoming . Breakfast a Lotus cafe is the highlight of the day, specially with staff like Vijay Dulagi, Hester Pereira, Mehta and many more. Lounge on the 4th floor so welcoming and refreshing. Hotel is no doubt expensive but in return you get fantastic service. Worth every penny."
2169,the service in lotus cafe is excellent as always the people over there pampers u a lot.they always make sure u get everything at rite time and the managers are also professional in their work.lotus cafe is the best place to relax with a drink and having a view of pool.
2170,"Super friendly staff, from check in to waiter staff. Beautiful hotel rooms and decor. The windows in the rooms don't open and look out on a very tired looking exterior of the hotel, but that is the ONLY downside of this hotel. Pity the pool bar only serves moctails. Great value for money."
2171,"This place has got a great infrastructure. If you're one of them who love infrastructures then, this place is for you too. Good food and great service and situated in the heart of Bombay. Lotus Cafe is an enticement location to relief all your stress with delicious food. I'll recommend Piccante Pepperoni. Over all it was a great experience to be there."
2172,We are at their coffee shop for a nice quiet meal and the whole place is full of loud sounds. ...clutter and loud noise of people cleaning the place ..sound of dishes being washed in the kitchen. .totally not expected from a Hotel of such a world wide repute.....when asked about it the answer was that the place was under maintenance but if such is the case they should shut down the place and then do the maintenance work...the food was served to us after a long time of waiting in such a noisy environment at 2am...very disappointing experience. ..while I am writing this the food is no where to be seen..seems like a fish market. ...never again! !!
2173,Was helped by a gentleman named Peter. Peter was very nice and helpful. Very nice hotel as well. Hotel was very neat and quiet. All accomadations were provided. Staff was very generous. Keep up the good work
2174,"Very nice decor - this place is popular with local rich folks and bollywood/tellywood folks. Those folks are given very special attention and more fancier the car that you get out from, the more importance you get from the doorman, security guard, and other staff. Some of these people are not even security scanned. They just walk in talking on their phone or brush the security person aside. Not a good feeling for someone who is staying at the hotel and watching that. One instance I got down with a large suitcase from a small dinky car and no one from the staff offered to help lift the same for security scan. I have not seen that at any other Marriott in India.  The staff at the restaurant is very cordial and go out of their way to make you feel like a VIP guest. On day 1, there"
2175,"The name itself should make you think its a marriott hotel ... it ll be worth... but after staying there i decided was it even worth the hype... apart from the location and the hotel interiors , nothing was worth it.... I stayed here for 2 nights. the second day when i came back to hotel at late noon after going around the city... to my horror my room was not clean yet... hello!!... its a 5star hotel and its not like i put a do not disturb sign... secondly during breakfast buffet while i was having breakfast with my family, i asked the waiter to get me some juice , he simply said you have to get it yourself , and went away. This is not how a 5star hotel staff behaves or reply ... and i have stayed in many to know i can ask them for stuffs... because of the staff i might not go"
2176,"Even if you don't stay here it is worth a visit just to see the wonderful architecture & grounds.  We had two nights & hated to leave the very comfortable rooms.  The bedding was comfy & the bathroom well appointed.  The views from our window permitted us to see our grandsons at the pool.  From the pool area there is a locked access to the beach if anyone is interested in testing the ocean waters.   The food here is outstanding.  Theirs may be the largest & most varied breakfast buffet I have ever seen, & includes the much appreciated fresh squeezed juices, & made to order fresh croissants or paratas as well as the usual assortment of fruits & made to order eggs.  And joy: pork bacon after having spent several nights in Gujarat where we had chicken. The selections lack for"
2177,"We were here for 3 days and  2 nights and found the hotel to be good but missing the genuine warmth. The staff are friendly and cooperative, rooms are clean and beds and pillows are  extremely comfortable. One incident didn't go down well. We ordered food at Lotus Cafe at 2.30 am and the staff was more interested in cleaning and setting up the place for morning breakfast and there was a delay in the food reaching us. The ""Bhuna Mutton"" was tough and was promptly removed from the bill once we brought it to the notice of the staff. And great part was that they came and sought out feedback after every interaction and were quick to react to feedback. We had a great stay and recommend this hotel to all. The executive lounge has a great setting and  watching the sunset from there was"
2178,stayed here on way home to Canada at the expense of united airline because of a cancelled flight. checked in a 5 AM and the staff were wonderful. got a little sleep in a very nice  clean room then had the lunch buffet that was just marvellous. Wanted to take a dip in the ocean-view pool but airline called us back to the airport. Many thanks to the the staff for a short but memorable stay.
2179,"This is a fantastic hotel, the room was extremely comfortable and the setting is quite pretty. I managed to pick up a bad bug before I landed in India, and the staff were very helpful and friendly and made everything much more bearable.  Once I was able to eat again, the breakfast tasted amazing and had lovely Sitar music playing in the background."
2180,Very expensive but undoubtedly the best hotel in Mumbai. The staff is very cooperative and the food is amazingly delicious. Had been here for a party and had a great time. A great place to reserve for corporate meetings and annual parties.
2181,"I would only say the main drawback of this hotel is the room size,else one of the finest and a classy hotel,very close to the juhu beach,perhaps one of the great relaxation point is the ambiance and the service Truely amazing"
2182,"JW Marriot is an exquisite place to stay. Its just home away from home.  If we compare other country's Marriots, you will find a much co-operative staff, interior, scenic beauty and everything one expect while on leisure tour. An immemorable experience."
2183,"We had two rooms at the jw marriott juhu for 5 nights whilst we attended a wedding. Yes the hotel is beautiful but it's the little touches and the amazing staff that make it. A few points: 1. I'm really fussy when u travel to India having had bad food poisoning. I would never touch fruit, ice or fruit juices. At the jw marriott lotus cafe I had all of these things with no problem at all.  2. At breakfast you have your own personal waiter (ours was Eliseus). He was amazing and made sure we ate well, was smiley, pleasant, addressed us by name every morning and kept our favourite table ready for us. The chefs come and have a chat with you and ask you if you want anything not on the menu as they will make it for you. Amazing food, amazing service, gorgeous view.  3. All the staff"
2184,On the beach this resort is very close to the airport  Have been to this property twice for overnight stays and it does not disappoint   Rooms are clean and well appointed  Staff is friendly and helpful  I normally dine in the club level for breakfast which has a nice mini Buffett
2185,This hotel is very close to the airport. Ambience is excellent and the fact that it neighbours Juhu beach provides for some excellent views from the room. Great place to stay with very courteous and friendly staff (as with all J.W. Marriott's I have stayed in the past).
2186,"This is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at.  The check in was fairly quick with the help of the friendly staff, every one of whom greet you with a traditional namaste. The rooms that our party stayed in on the fourth floor were well fitted out and the bed was one of the best I have ever slept in.   As for the breakfast, that was certainly the best (noticed the repeated use of the word best, that's because it is very appropriate) I have ever had. The selection of the international and regional dishes from India was the widest I have seen and they give you plenty of time to enjoy them. Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 11:00. Pool area is clean and well maintained, leading to the public beach and beachfront shacks. Usual precautions about Indian beaches"
2187,"One thing to point out immediately is that you will pay a luxury tax of 10% on the room rate. Of course it is in keeping with the Marriot chain and a very nice hotel. You will get exceptional service and the location is great, although prepare for a long and slow journey because of the one way traffic system cars have to go around the block. Rooms are lovely, staff are attentive and the hotel experience really is a joy. Nice shops and a bakery on site for that morning coffee or business meetings."
2188,"Having stayed at this hotel on a few occasions, this hotel is an oasis in Mumbai. The Oberoi in Mumbai offer unparalleled service, however the JW Marriott offers the over overall package. The outdoor pool overlooking the beach make the property feel like you are in a resort and not just in a hotel.  Rooms are not the biggest in class, however clean and comfortable.   The property is private gated and once you enter the hotel lobby you can forget about the madness outside, despite the hotel being on a busy road. There is also access to the beach from the pool side and security is fantastic.    Breakfast Buffet spread is always the one thing i look forward to here, never rushed. The Gym and Spa are really nice too.   Highly recommend hotel as close to most of the nice bars and"
2189,This hotel holds the best location . We were really comfortable inspite of mumbai traffic and so much of delays in the transport caused . Our Friends stayed nearby and the hotel authority never objected my friends visit in the rooms .
2190,"One of my fav's for hotels. Every time I am in Mumbai, this is where I stay. Service is great and the lounge is one of the best. Service is always prompt. Rooms are very nice. I usually stay on the exec. floor. Location is good, except if traveling to Marine Lines, then give yourself about an hour due to traffic."
2191,"incredible hotel with an amazing pool. was here for a wedding and was blown away by the first class quality of everything we experienced at the hotel. the rooms were very clean although small.  It would have been hard to have a third in the room - even a child. the entire hotel is immaculately kept. the pool is amazing - except unfortunately they are not permitted to serve alcohol outside (just at the pool, you can get it everywhere else) which is a bit of a let down only because when it is 90F outside a cold kingfisher can really hit the spot. the breakfast buffet should win an award, seriously one of the best i have ever had anywhere in the world.  The food in general was very good and had a nice variety of cuisines.  it is over an hour drive into south mumbai to see the sites"
2192,And homely too. Rooms are good. Superb food. And service. There pool and gym and restaurants are a class. I can recommend this hotel to everyone. Only constrain being price. However in give star category we have to accept this. There back side is particularly good. People will allow you stroll in Juhu beach.
2193,"A great hotel, fantastic service, very friendly staff. very comfortable rooms. The breakfast at Marriott is just superb. All the staff were very helpful and made our stay very pleasant. We will definitely stay there again. My wife used to love Hotel Sea-Princess, but JW Marriott is in a different class, much better. Unfortunately, our stay was cut short by four nights ( even though we had paid in advance) due to a death in the family. A. Shah. Kenya."
2194,"We stayed here for a wedding for three nights. Beautiful property. The food was amazing, the staff was accommodating, the rooms were clean and well designed, and the pool area felt very luxurious. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
2195,"The JW Marriott in Juhu is at a fantastic location.  We got a room with a view of the Beach and Swimming pool - highly recommend this!  The Room was small, but very clean and comfortable - nice Bathroom, though the Exhaust could be better! The BOSE speaker & docking station was a good touch - However, I had to use my own AUX to AUX cable to connect the Docking Station to the BOSE speakers.  Breakfast - HUGE Buffett spread. IT was very NICE, not Great in terms of flavour & taste.  Service - GOOD  Did not visit any other restaurants this trip but have eaten at the Bombay Baking Company earlier - Good.  Checkout was easy, quick. Marriott has a system of fast checkout if you use their APP. Can get details at the Front Desk.  The Hotel is huge, its easy to lose your kids - be careful!"
2196,"Quan Spa has 10 treatment rooms. Services include body wraps, body scrubs, and body treatments. A variety of treatment therapies are provided, including aromatherapy and Ayurvedic. I had a really nice experiance."
2197,"My family stay in Merriot at 29 of May , great experience , nice staff , nice breakfast even nice location , room sizes are very good and also very comfortable, even my child also point some celebrities there, unforgettable tour , soon visit again"
2198,"Hotel JW Marriott is one of the best hotels I have ever been to. Great Ambience, Nice Atmosphere, Good Food, Very helping staff, Prompt response etc. In short, all things were just perfect. Sea facing rooms particularly are an icing on cake. You never know when you will bump into a bollywood celebrity here either in Gym or Pool or Restaurant as most of them are very regular visitors in this hotel."
2199,"The entire service team performed way beyond our expectations, and we very much enjoyed the hospitality. From the moment we arrived through the gates of your hotel we were welcomed as ""houseguests"".      The traditional Sikh attired doormen at the hotel entrance always greeted us every morning, either coming or going with a lovely smile, and ensured we were looked after getting in and out of various cars, and taxis. The breakfast team worked twice as hard to make up for the typical morning rush, and it was much appreciated that Chef would come out to say hello, and make sure all was in order. A superb breakfast in the mornings -  more akin to a ""Dubai Friday Brunch"", with a wide ranging selection of different cuisines with individual cooking stations. We also loved the low key"
2200,"This place always feels like home with friendly staff and the best cuisines. More over it is centrally located to most places of interest, shopping malls, restaurants, pubs etc. If you stay here once, your definitely going to come  back again."
2201,"The location is by the sea, so that's fantastic. If you're looking to commute within the city, you might want to check its proximity to places you may frequent regularly. The Juhu beach traffic can making getting to the place a hassle during peak hours. The hotel is fantastic and staff very polite. Love the breakfast buffet :)"
2202,"Nice hotel, right on Juhu beach-great for a morning walk/run. Nice decent sized rooms, good service, great breakfast. Hotel is always full of people. The traffic outside is horrendous. Otherwise a great stay."
2203,"We went to the hotel for our anniversary celebrations. The hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to the next category rooms on their executive floor, just overlooking the sea. The view was one to die or kill for (depends on your perspective ;)). Even so, the size of the room was less than grand and despite some smart furniture arrangement, does not give you a luxurious feel. The service continued quietly though with the management sneaking in our complimentary bday gift.  The pool is expansive and grand. The kiddie pool area with the slide is a treat. Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol outside the hotel due to some licensing issues. That was a big letdown. The pool is not an infinity one though it could so easily have been one since it is just abutting the beach. Didn't get"
2204,I have stayed in JW Marriott since 2004 and have seen it go through its changes. Now with new refurbished rooms the atmosphere and quality is great. The rooms aren't huge but have all the mod cons you need when traveling on business or pleasure. Sitting right in the beach at Juhu this is Bollywood central and it's not uncommon to bump into a celebrity. Great pool and the buffet breakfast here is really world class. Great chefs who take pride in their food and walk the floors speaking to guests. Hard to past the omlette here as it's the best I've had. Great beds and services and staff are very friendly. Bring your swimmers as this place has a great pool and gym.
2205,"Every year for the last 3 years I have stayed at the Marriott and I love the hotel. There just a lovely feel, whether it's the breakfast hall which is open, food is good and the service is excellent or the upstairs bar which the smaller sections or the very comfy rooms.   For about ¬£100 per day, I'm not sure there is anywhere in the world that's better value for the quality.   I will say the only down side this time was the front desk that I found check in to be very slow and they took a massive deposit of over 66,000 Rupees so make sure you have space on your card."
2206,"A very large hotel but very friendly service in all respects (less the concierge lounge).  Usually this is the most attentive and friendly aspect of a JW.    All other aspects to include the absolutely stunning waterfront location were superb.  The hotels amenities, services and rooms are all high quality."
2207,Front desk Shahnawaz unsmiling face Just asked ocean view room without checking standard answer SOLD OUT but than guest executive priayanka handled the situation nicely and almost complied with every request.overall highly cooperative staff  had good fun filled beach holiday for three days. Staff at Saffron highly hospitable and almost served everything asked for.good musical programme during dinner. Vikash Chowdry specially cared for everything.chef Nishad took care during breakfast both days.food quality excellent
2208,"The property if fabulous!  Easy to move around the hotel without having to get into the grind of the masses.  Excellent Pool and spa facilities.  Executive lounge staff was very friendly and accomodating.  Relaxing in the lounge and watching the sun set was one of the many highlights.  Rooms were very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The beach and water (Arabian Sea) were dirty and trash laden, but what do you expect for this populous location.  I've travelled much of the world and stated upon my return that this was the best hotel I've ever stayed in."
2209,"The hotel is still maintained very well. The staff is great. Even though I checked in after mid night, the lobby and reception were busy, but they managed to hasten the process and didn't make me wait.   The staff was polite and courteous.   The rooms are well equipped and very well maintained.   The breakfast is excellent. Great spread and good food, just the way I remembered it from years ago.   Though I didn't go to the beach early morning, but I am sure it would have been nice.   A recommended hotel if you want to stay around Juhu."
2210,"Was at the hotel for a day for a conference.The people at the front desk were pathetic,did not know that i had a booking ,in spite of the booking having been done earlier and they had received a mail about the same from a multinational comapny. The same incident was repeated at check out also when they said you will have to pay in spite of the company having sent them a letter that they would settle the bill.  The rooms are as expected on the 5 star lines, food is good, they have a good view though i was given a room facing some houses.  Yes will not come back to this hotel until they improve their services!!"
2211,"I stayed here with my wife for 4 nights in mid January while visiting for a relatives wedding from NYC.  This definitely ranks at the top of the list when it comes to Mumbai hotels and that says something considering the bar is set very high in this city.  It has it all from a safety perspective (numerous security barriers from the gate to the lobby), to friendly staff (each person we encountered from Bellman, such as the very helpful MR. PANKAJ, to Housekeeping to management greeted us with a gracious ""Namaste"" and checked on us constantly), to delicious meals (we only had a chance to try the breakfast but it was the best we ever had) and Marriott level quality.  The GM is running a great ship here.  Only downside is that its quite full at times on weekdays because everyone"
2212,We had a lovely 6 nights in a ocean view room with executive lounge access.We we were like in a dream because of very beautiful hotel.friendly staff and well organised restaurants. It is located by Juhu Beach .they have a good spa.pool amenities as well as lovely executive lounge .We were relaxing everyday at this lounge with very delicious food and drinks after a busy day.Thanks to JWMariott.
2213,JW Marriott is an oasis in the chaos of Mumbai. The breakfast is incredible as they have such a wide range of freshly made Indian and western cuisines delivered to your table upon request. The service was outstanding. The gym is well equipped and spacious. The members lounge is also chilled and comfortable with friendly staff. I would definitely recommend upgrading to get lounge access - it's worth it
2214,"Stayed for a week. The location is nice, overlooks Juhu beach. The Indian restaurant has excellent kebabs. The staff is courteous enough. The only thing I hated in the rooms were the sombre / eerie looking faces on the paintings that adorn the walls. I wish the rooms had a more cheerful ambience!"
2215,"Only came to the hotel for a drink with the family.. However have to say that it is a beautiful property in Mumbai..as soon as you enter you feel the luxury..had a drink with the family at the bar on the floor of the reception. Not sure what it was called, however the service I received was exceptional. Have to mention Joel, Abishek and Daniel who served me with a smile and were brilliant. Nothing was a problem for them and they deserve to be commended for their brilliant service. Definitely check this hotel out! It's a must...!"
2216,"Like India itself, the Mariott in Mumbai has a lot to like, but some things not to like as well. When you walk in the entrance (after your taxi driver has had to open his trunk and hood, and guards with a dog check under the car), you are drawn to the wonderful view from the lobby. Below you is the vast dining area where, if you're smart, you'll eat every meal and choose the buffet price. Beyond that is an immense window through which you see the meandering, free-form pool (it's more like a stream) outside, where you can swim, wade, or just relax on the terry-cloth covered chaise longues. And beyond THAT is the beach and the Arabian Sea. Truly a wonderful location. In addition, virtually everyone who works for the hotel gives you the pressed-hand greeting and welcomes you, every"
2217,"Having stayed at many JW Marriott hotels in the past I was shocked at the level of service at this hotel. In four days we moved rooms twice. The first time was because we found a live cockroach in our room so we got moved to another room. This room was given to us by mistake so we got moved again, only to be given the key to a wrong room, which was occupied by a group of adult men. We were forced to apologies for walking into them half naked! A complete and utter security breach! The second room was a smoking room (we'd booked a non-smoking room). Once in the second room our room phone didn't work so we couldn't contact our family members who were now on another floor to us. Room service took more than an hour to be delivered to us and a number of calls had to be made to"
2218,"We have stayed at the Marriot Mumbai before and was very satisfied overall but our last stay in Dec 2014 was very disappointing. From the front desk it was unpleasant when we were told breakfast was not included in our stay and was asked for proof of that. We had to go and print an email and show that we had paid for breakfast. Our rooms were very dated and  it was late at night when we found our mattress had big hollows, the bath robes had holes in them and the room was very dusty, the light in the shower didn't work.A board was brought in to put under the mattress which we declined and was moved to another room which was no better around 2 am in the morning. Finally the next day we were moved to the third room, never mind all the inconvenience of packing and unpacking. We were"
2219,it was a very good and memorable experience.  normally i stayed at ramada plaza but after this experience i will always prefer jw.  rooms were excellent with sea view was bonus. the inside atmosphere of the hotel was also very pleasent
2220,"I got to the hotel having booked sea facing rooms, they didn't have any available, after arguing and threatening to check out the hotel manager upgraded us, this whole process took 4 to 5 hours we didn't have a room, after traveling for almost 8 hours this was very frustrating. This was fortunately the only problem I experienced, the room service was on point, the hotel staff was friendly and welcoming, the breakfast was on par and the rooms really impressed me, although the beds and pillows weren't very comfortable. It has alot of ambience and is sophisticated. I had an executive package which included the executive lounge, here you get free food and drinks for the day, service there was amazing but the food wasn't much to scream about. All in all I enjoyed my stay except for"
2221,The service was excellent and the overall ambience of the hotel was very welcoming. I had a great time. The staff were helpful in all the queries and so was their presence.The front desk service was prompt and courteous. Its a perfect hotel for family stay and homely atmosphere. I had a pleasant experience .
2222,"Hi All  I have this hotel many times and always provided with best services to all my guest coming through, Excellent Environment and with great hospitality. Room Seems to be good and perfect for both business and for entertainemtn"
2223,"We had a less than acceptable reception at an establishment down the road so this hotel was just heaven. As you would expect from a JW Marriot the staff were very attentive and friendly. Perhaps as we opted for the execuitve floor the rooms ,we found, were spacious and spotless also including a happy ""hour"" from 5:30 - 9:30 in the executive lounge that overlooked the beach. The lounge was very well stocked with food and drinks with comfortable chairs to relax in and take in the view. The breakfast was one of the largest selections I have come across with something for even the fussiest of tastes. Certainly not what you would call intimate dining as the area is huge but plenty of space between tables."
2224,"I stayed in the deluxe room with a two separate beds. The front desk service was prompt and courteous. House keeping was upto mark. Its location is right on the beach front on Juhu Mumbai, probably the only clean beach in Mumbai. That possibly also accounts for the fact that the room size was a little smaller than what one would expect. The other grouse was against the design. The basin, commode and shower areas were all crammed into a small place with glass partitions between them and sliding panels between the wash area and the living space. Perhaps the other rooms or higher category are better designed. Overall not a deal breaker but just a minor irritantThe swimming pool was well maintained and beautiful. Overall, not a"
2225,"OMG Was this a 5 star hotel ?  Stingy small rooms , pathetic pillows and quite average service. When I requested for a harder pillow they Have run out of pillows ... In a so called 5 star hotel ... Coming to then rooms , you hardly have space to walk through ... Tinier than hotels with 1/3 rd of the price.  I had stayed on a group booking with a breakfast package ... This bf was not a part of the regular one and was separately arranged ... I'm not exaggerating ... One of the ugliest bf I have ever had ... You can find better ones even in budget hotels. For eg on one day the breakfast just had dried poori , bread some fruits and egg. In JW Marriot. You believe. Does airlines make you sit on the floor if you pay lesser ... That was exactly how you were treated ....  I never"
2226,"We stayed at the JW Royal Lotus Suite over the Christmas period 2014. The Managers were good, the pool staff excellent. However, they were too busy to give us any attention. One night we found a cockroach in our suite. We were horrified and called them; their reaction was to send the room cleaner (who did an awful job of cleaning our suite) to remove it. No apology and no further mention of it whatsoever! We were appalled. Another incident was when we ate the oysters in the Lotus restaurant. We were down with the most awful food poisoning. At least the chef showed concern and sent up some khichdi and boiled veg to our rooms. When we were leaving, the Marriott drivers (in spite of being told we were unwell) drove us far out of our way instead of to the airport, to insist we go"
2227,"One of the absolute top hotels. Exemplary service. Lovely location. Heaven for a foodie. Chefs Himsnshu, Shanawaz and Rohan made this a wonderful stay. Rooms....stayed in a nice spacious suite. Bathroom was huge which makes things feel more like home. There is no other choice in Mumbai."
2228,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel.  This visit was for three nights.  It is right on Juhu Beach and overall if this is the area in which you need to be there are some great aspects to it.  First, the service is outstanding.  The concierge staff, front desk, drivers and housekeeping staff were very attentive.  The room was large and clean.  One major issue for me was how dark the room was.  I had every light on in the room and it was not bright enough to see well - even in the morning.  The glass windows are tinted (a must in the summer heat, which is when I was here the first time), but leave the room dark because there is limited lighting.  Putting make up on was a challenge.  The second frustration was the very poor internet service.  I tried everything but"
2229,"Hello,  We were in Mumbai this past December (2014) for a friend's wedding and stayed 6 nights at this hotel. Fantastic hotel, wonderful location right on the beach. Rooms were great as always at a J.W. Restaurant was first class and the breakfast buffet had it all. Definitely not the cheapest but when you want the best, this is it. Extremely friendly and courteous staff as well. The pool facilities were great. Also make sure you go to the restaurant Mahesh next door for the curry crab. About a 100 meters from the hotel to the left as you come out the front gate of the J.W. Not cheap but worth it. Regards, Paul"
2230,Dear Guests Be Warned when checking out of #JWMarriott Mumbai and if paying with a card. Guests have to make sure to check their bank or card statements online for accuracy on billings. I have just realised Marriott has tripled billed on a two nights stay. When requested for an explanation and demand for refund they state it takes 3-5 working days.  But that doesn't help as funds are already debited  Guests Be Warned!
2231,"Had a terrible stay at J W Marriot.  Although the hotel was nice but the inability of staff and their attitude ruined our stay and not only once, but twice we were insulted due to their own error and it felt like we were refugees in the hotel.  Would never recommend it to anyone and even after writing to the hotel, we have not received any reply.  Terrible customer service."
2232,"It was very relaxing from tension of two days in crowd of Mumbai. Altho there for business, from a personal perspective I felt so comfortable and pampered! Looked forward to returning to my room each day. Staff/service incredible! Good choice of restaurants."
2233,I was here with family for over 3 nights and absolutely loved the ambience of this property. The best part of the stay was its location where you could step out into the Juhu beach. The staff is cooperative and provides you with the required information. Was quite impressed with the breakfast spread.
2234,"I have stayed at this hotel twice for business, both times on the Executive Floor 4.   The flight times mean I always arrive late at night, but this does not matter as the hotel room service is 24 hours with a really full menu, which is fantastic! I ate quite a few times in the room and always found it really good, they present the food on a trolley which doubles as a table which is really nice.  The gym facilities are also 24 hours and they are really good. I am a member of Virgin Active in the UK and they have all the machines I have at my gym and more! I love it when a hotel has a good gym, and as its 24 hours you can go anytime to fit in with your jet lag.  The changing rooms have a Jacuzzi, sauna and steam which are open until 11pm and you can use these if if your not"
2235,"I, accompanied by my wife, was at JW Marriott to attend a conference on the very first weekend of 2015. In spite of being in a conference, it was a very romantic stay for us. The rooms are large enough, neat and clean with a wonderful bathroom. Bathroom has a very good shower, just makes you feel relaxed. Every room is has a sea view. The view from the room of the sea as well as the garden and swimming pool is just awesome. Being in a conference, our dinner was arranged on the pool and garden side, and it was wonderful. The hotel is facing Juhu beach. It is a public beach, and the hotel management takes care of your security, by noting name and room number of every guest going to the beach from the hotel. They have a spa and three restaurants. Overall, a very pleasant experience."
2236,the staff at the hotel was very helpful and polite . the breakfast is very good with an extravagant array of all items you can think of. we were given very good service by the restaurant manager Sachin Padlekar ( who was very hospitable on both the days that we stayed esp the second day when i was not feeling well / was down with fever and requested him to arrange for a table asap as I did not have the energy to wait 15-20 mins for a table .......i got a table immediately ... i am very thankful to him and jw for this amazing service) and Ravi ( who was very attentive and hospitable during breakfast on both days ). Room service needs some improvement ..... the food takes ages to arrive and the orders are not taken very accurately..... thus i have not given this hotel a rating of
2237,"Great location, nice and large hotel in Mumbai.  This hotel was very nice and had a great, amazing breakfast buffet with wide variety of continental and indian foods which were very tasty.  The room service options and food was excellent as well.  The rooms were nice and very comfortable and beds were comfy.  Rooms were very spacious.  The executive lounge was okay, they only had limited hours and kids were not allowed. I went at 11pm and asked for a drink to take to my room, the lounge was closed for drinks but they gave it to me.  They did not tell me they would charge me for it and was upset to find a charge on my bill when I checked out.  They provide a lot of free water bottles in room daily....The bathroom had a cool screen which you can electronically close for privacy"
2238,"A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff and wonderful guests. From the moment we arrived we were pampered and looked after like we were old friends coming to visit. Unfortunately we arrived unwell so after quick call to concierge our requested medicines from a local chemist arrived in 20 mins. Thank you for that.  We upgraded to executive room which was well worth it for the use of lounge. Lovely place to have a drink and nibble and watch the sun go down whilst mingling with other guests. Nothing was too much trouble here. Right on juhu beach and at the weekend was great watching kids play cricket on the beach.  Everything beautifully maintained and full of glamour. very very reasonabley priced!   All there maybe bigger, grander more glitzy hotels, none have the Indian charm"
2239,"Juhu beach is nice to look at but not a place to relax. The Marriott on the other hand would be excellent, accept in our case the entire pool area was closed off for a wedding.  It was total disappointment for us. But I can see enjoying the stay otherwise."
2240,"I've stayed at this hotel on 4 occasions  and wonders never cease .  Fantastic Service, the restaurant variants with excellent cuisine, massive variety of breakfast from fresh juices, cereals, pancakes and waffles to idli  sambar and even puris.  The bars are out of this world with live music in one and what once   used to be called Enigma.    I remember coming in from a scorcher of a day and having a chilled kingfisher with some salted cashew nuts.... words cannot describe this small but awesome feeling and experience!  Staying here,  can be pricey but what do you expect  when staying at one of the finest hotels in Mumbai???  The rooms are clean and the  room service exquisite.  I remember coming home at 4 am from  a night out and ordering some room service .  The food was"
2241,"In town for a business trip in Dec 2014.  Suman was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable about neighboring restaurants, great customer service!  Also the breakfast was amazing and the staff was phenomenal, including the chef Patel.  Overall a wonderful experience!"
2242,"This hotel was awesome.  We stay at JW Marriott whenever we can, and I would say this is one of the best ones we have stayed at.  Beach access, perfect for families.  Breakfast buffet is of the highest quality.  Overall, customer service is excellent.  We had a few minor issues with front staff typical for India, but nothing major.  We stayed a JW in Delhi, and while it was nice and new, it was nowhere near as great as this one.  I would stay here again next time we are in Mumbai.  This hotel is located near Santa Cruz/Airport/lots of shopping.  It is not in downtown Mumbai which is a good 35-60 min away by car depending on traffic.  We loved it."
2243,Juhu Wala Mariott as Amitabh Bachchan calls it is the bext hotel in mumbai!!!!must go place...  great food...near juhu where so many bollywood celebs keep hopping....  Diffrent atmosphere here.....too much glamour
2244,"This hotel has so many things to offer its guests, it often felt like I was on a cruise ship or an all inclusive and not just a hotel. * There were lots of excellent restuarants to choose from: Spanish, Italian, Asian, Western style cafe. * On the weekends there was entertainment in the main lobby overlooking the buffett * The spa was excellent with hot baths, sauna and steam room / Quality gym  The service always went above and beyond to be helpful- for me sometimes almost too helpful.  I ended up putting the do not disturb sign on my door as they were stopping by every 20 minutes to offer fruit, water, etc.  In the cafe I was able to order sandwiches /salads to take the night before to pick up in the mornings.  My only complaint about the hotel has less to do with it, then"
2245,"Great for business travel. Not so much for leisure.  Understand with safety, but the security was a bit over-the-top, and lacked any real sense of freedom. Getting to the beach was tough. Restrictions at the pool were many.  Beautiful of course, great food, and stellar service. But lacked a sense of exploration and freedom at the expense of safety and security."
2246,"Stayed at JW Marriott for a few days in Dec 2014 and had a fabulous experience.  Lovely, spacious, clean room with sea view and access to executive lounge.  Breakfast was a fantastic experience - exceptional choice of hot / cold dishes and food prepared to individual order as well as self-service buffet.  Service provided by waiting staff is second to none.  Staff and service across the hotel was first-rate.  We have stayed at numerous 5-star hotels across Asia, Europe and America and this rates highly relative to our other experiences.  We had a memorable stay at the JW Marriott - met several bollywood stars and location enabled us to venture out to some tourist spots."
2247,"Marriott Hotel in Mumbai is quite nice. The hotel offers a broad selection of typical 5 star services. The location is quite good to explore Mumbai and get a feeling of the city. The breakfast buffet is huge, tasty and offers something for everyone. The gym is well-equipped and what I heard used by Bollywood stars who are living in the area.  The staff is very friendly and helpful so you feel quite good during the stay. The rooms are quite ok. Nothing breathtaking but definitely on a 5 star level with small amenities which makes it a pleasant stay.   No surprises with the hotel and definitely recommendable for a hustle free stay in Mumbai.  However, no free wifi in a 5 star hotel is not up to date anymore."
2248,"My aunt from US was put up there.  Good service. Posh decor. Ideal for business travelers.  Also, you could meet a few Bollywood stars there.  Have their own night club, ENIGMA. Young crowd.  You should stay there for the experience."
2249,"There's essentially no fear for choosing a well known hotel brand like JW Marriott in a business city like Mumbai.  The security is tight, every vehicle is checked by security personnel and guard dog on the driveway.  There's also second level security check before entering the hotel area.  Before strolling along the beach area (not fit for swimming), there's also security check point and a log book.  Every floor has security cameras  Outdoor swimming pools are gorgeous overlooking the Mumbai Bay area.  The hotel cafe offers great buffet items and √Ä la carte menu.  Other inhouse eateries are excellent too.  Since it may be difficult to get air-conditioned taxis outside the hotel so if you can, just arrange to rent either a half-day or full day taxi service.  But check with the"
2250,This is one of the to be seen places in the suburbs of Mumbai. It facing the ocean and thats always beautiful. The many restaurants in this place serve fantastic food. The people are super friendly. The drinks served at the main bar are fantastic. Its a great place to hang out. It can get noisy and very busy on weekends and that is a big deterrent to people who want to spend a quiet evening with friends.
2251,"Went to Mumbai for the last tree days of our trip to India.... Fantastic hotel, fantastic food and fantastic party too!   The service was unfaultable... Excellent end to a fantastic holiday!  Would definitely recommend this hotel!   Thank you to all staff that helped us!"
2252,"Good choice of hotel if one wants to be in the suburbs of  Mumbai such as Bandra, Juhu etc. Not convenient if more work is in city centre as the traffic can get really bad in morning and evening. The service is good and they have several restaurant options. Try to ask for a sea facing view as that's much better than looking at the crowded streets on the other side.."
2253,Attending a medical conference where all elite doctors of country are staying. Where to start I don't know  Pathetic banquet with sub minimal snacks and food Sub minimal waiters to serve snacks  No hot water in room Lights were off twice and need to call room services 4 times in night and early morning  Rooms very very far from elevator.  Highly unrecommended hotel specially if u r in a group bookings or conference  .
2254,What an amazing place I didn't feel like leaving.  10 mins drive from the airport.  Very safe hotel and security at gates excellent and polite.  The food is amazing and my orders for items not on the menu were also catered for.   The gardens and pool area an oasis of calm.   My favourite place in Mumbai.  Thank you
2255,"Pleasant stay at Juhu. Overlooking the beach.  3 swimming pools. Polite staff willing to meet all requests of guests.Popular with non resident Indians visiting India for the New Year's Eve holidays. Neat and clean rooms, great breakfast spreads."
2256,"wow, wot a hospitality and exceptionally wonderful staff. In busy Juhu area this wonderful oasis is like god send.  In hot humid MUmbai with crazy traffic jams, we could only wait to get back into comfort and safety of this jewel.  Staff couldn't stop saying namaste and bowing, which became embarrassing after a while.  Dining hall, swimming pools and lobby area absolutely fantastic, concierge services spot on.  If u wanna travel in style hire hotels own car , bit expensive but worth every penny.    Only down side was , when I choose to accept for private taxi hire by reception staff, the driver was exceptionally good but then hassle of charging extra because we got stuck in traffic and so on, next day we just hired hassle free hotel transport which was absolutely amazing.  Food"
2257,"Fantastic hotel, won't go into too much detail because I'd be here all day. I'm a platinum member at Marriott (due to travelling a lot with work) but this is by far and away the nicest. Great staff, incredible service, beautiful pool. Very relaxing, makes you feel special. Oh and the buffet breakfast is probably the best thing about any hotel I've ever stayed in....I know it sounds strange, but just wait :)"
2258,Visited the hotel at 7:30 today evening with family 9 ppl. Completed dinner at 10. The security vallet has been fooling me for 2 hrs now.... They have lost my Honda city car key. Even a road side restaurant is capable to manage vallet system.
2259,"Recently stayed in Jaipur at the Marriott and it's safe to say that the same quality and comfort is available at this hotel.  Marriott hotels sure do ensure that their guests are taken care of by providing state of the art rooms, fantastic restaurants, fully equipped facilities, and this specific Marriott hotel has such a fantastic backdrop of an awesome pool with Juhu beach just a stone throw away.  Definitely recommending this hotel to all prospective guests!"
2260,I stayed at the Marriott for just over a week in early December for a work conference. For such a long stay I really enjoyed being in the hotel though it is a bit of a distance to the main tourist attractions/restaurants. I also appreciated the extra effort that the staff displayed. Firstly it was my birthday whilst staying at the hotel and I arrived back after a being out for the day to find a nice birthday wishes note and a lovely birthday cake I certainly did not expect that and I really appreciated this gesture given so far away from home on my birthday. At the end of my stay I hurt my back rather badly walking up the front stairs..the start of several hours of excruciating pain.. Though the hotel staff were amazing as they helped me get up the next flight of stairs and into
2261,"Before there is a reply from guest services explaining that my experience was a one off I can categorically say that by the end of our visit, the mishaps and critical errors were quite comical. I mean where to start?  - loud noise in 2x rooms not dealt with despite 6 calls to reception, 1 security guard promised all night to look after the issue and 1 manager visit to our room; - doors being knocked on in the middle of the night; - when we did decide to get some rest in the day time as we struggled to get any noiseless sleep in the night, we go disturbed twice saying that our safe needed to be fixed. This was despite a do not disturb sign placed on our room. Plus there was no issue with the safe! - no lights in the shower. Issue raised 7 times; - soap, shampoo and body wash not"
2262,"I recently stayed here for as a quick stopover in Mumbai before heading down to Goa.   We arrived very early in the morning and I was really pleased that there was a room available so we could shower and change. In fact, as a platinum elite member I even got an apology that there was no suite available - I really didn't care as having travelled overnight from Dubai I just wanted a room.  Breakfast was fantastic- the best spread I've ever seen in a Marriott hotel. The staff couldn't do enough to help and were attentive without being interfering. The food was fresh, cooked in front of you and there was something for everyone. The exec lounge was also excellent - it was well stocked through the day, the afternoon tea and snacks of an evening were fantastic quality and imaginative."
2263,"I always try and stay in this hotel when in the city, it's a bit more expensive then some of the other 4/5 stars in the airport/Juhu area but well worth the extra. It has everything you need, great restaurants, super pool and sunbathing facilities. The gym is great and never too busy with lots of equipment. The rooms are just big enough with lovely walk in showers. I also love The Oberoi but it's way downtown so for my business and airport vicinity it's perfect."
2264,"It was a pleasant stay having returned to JW since my last stay in Jan 2010 upto when it was my regular place to stay in Mumbai.what has changed for the better is the room decor .the rush for a table  at the Lotus for breakfast remains horrendous ,and service could be much better and faster  as we can compare thar to Novotel which is meant to be less ."
2265,"This Hotel has small rooms, no Spacious feel at all, congested rooms. Accessing the hotel on a Sunday can  Be a nightmare.The corridors have a moldy smell, they need to work on that. The layout for the Breakfast was Amazing! the service was excellent, the Chef Mehta, was going around  Checking if all was ok. The best part of our stay was the Breakfast. The view from the rooms to the Sea was and poolside was Nice too!"
2266,On arrival I can honestly say I was hugely disappointed. Nobody to help with bags!  The fishy smell in the reception was horrendous. The welcome  exceptionally poor. No welcome drink or garland flowers. The week has steadily got worse. The request for a spa brochure was made 5 times. Still haven't had it!  Managed to book some treatments - only one therapist on in the morning - he/she didn't turn up! The request for towells took several attempts.   We usually stay in the Taj Lands End!  That's where we will be returning.   Massive fail JW Marriott
2267,"As the title reads, my stay at the hotel was a mixed bag. The key to a good stay at the hotel will be to make sure you request for things you want. To elaborate, my booking was done a long time ago in August for a non smoking room double bed. I arrive to know that I have been booked into a smoking, twin bed room and the selling point was that the room faced the sea. Having politely insisted on a non smoking room I was shifted four floors down to a room facing the city with a promise (which was never kept) to move me the next night to the exact room which was requested for in the first place. Being on a business trip, I did not insist however, if I was on a family holiday I would have to be insistent to get the room I wanted.   Food is good with a large buffet breakfast and"
2268,"The hotel is placed quite near the airport so it's convinient to arrive and leave. It is in a neighborhood that is becoming ""hip"" and there is some quite good stores in the neighborhood. If you're looking for India, don't stay here. It is America by Indian imagination. I got a room that smelled so much smoke that my stuff smelled like I was a smoker myself.. I had asked for a non smoking room when booking but had to spend one night in this smoke pit since it wasn't possible to change. The day after the change was well managed when I was out on business. The restaurants, one Italian, one Spanish, one Indian and one canteen are not very good. The best is the Indian. The Spanish advertises it self as a ""one star Michelin"" restaurant. When asking the staff they are very insistent"
2269,"While this is a lovely hotel and a really rate the beds and linen, the primary reason that I decided to stay was that friends and I wanted to meet at the bar for the night. Only to find on the night the bar was closed for a private function. Very disappointing, I feel that if certain facilities will be unavailable the management should let you know when booking.  The Sunday Brunch is fantastic with amazing food, service for drinks was very slow though."
2270,"Spent one night at JW Marriott for business purpose and I experienced a new level of luxury. Right from the moment you enter the hotel lobby till the time you drop dead on the heavenly bed, every thing you touch and feel is excellent in this hotel. There is nothing to complain about the staff and service and food in the spread of buffet is never ending. The only disappointment was that I was not allowed to access the beach for a night stroll. I am guessing that is for a reason so I would not complain too much."
2271,"We had a wonderful here in November. The staff were friendly and helpful, particularly giving help to my elderly, wheelchair bound parents. Breakfasts are amazing. Also try the cake shop- excellent, fresh selection. Most enjoyable."
2272,I spend a week at JW Marriott Juhu beach in June 2014. This is an excellent hotel with great facilities and service. Some hiccups with the wifi and how it is charged but overall very pleasant stay. The beach is filthy but that's got nothing to do with the hotel.
2273,"This must have been our 4th stay at the JW Marriott in Juhu. We adore this hotel for it's location on Juhu beach and its sophisticated service.  On the plus: hotel infrastructure is top-notch, renovated rooms - although small in size and AC tough to control - are well appointed, nice pool area, beach access, good choice of restaurants, high quality breakfast with excellent service (esp. from the chef's who will do any effort for pleasing any special requirement), spa area is great, very good gym, etc... On the minus: both check-in and check-out experience were horrible. We were checked-in by over-stressed front desk staff radiating stress and negativism on our moods, and were checked-out by some trainee that just couldn't handle the process. This definitely does not represent"
2274,The food served at the restraurent is very good. The makhani dal is so tasty and the nans are so freshly baked. Further the abience is so peacefully and soothing that i didn't want to leave the place after my dinner.
2275,"We stayed here for a night at the end of November '14 which was almost 6 years after I had last been here. I was expected a fall in overall quality - room, service, etc. - when we decided to the stay night. But I was very wrong. The hotel is still one of the best properties in Mumbai.  We stayed in the Deluxe Double Room with Pool Access which is by itself isn't a very spacious room but does sufficient justice to its price tag. The view from the room was super. The pool and the sea beyond gave the room the 'space'.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had from all over the world. Ranging from local to Continental to American, it ensures satisfaction of every taste. The hotel was busy with guests and local visitors as well since it was a Saturday and this worked well"
2276,Location is outside of the CBD so expect to be stuck in traffic if you have business. But the advantage is that you are in a quiet neighborhood in the evening and can walk around to restaurants and on the beach. Really a quiet haven in busy Mumbai.  Airport pick up arranged by hotel is very efficient. Limos even have WIFI in them! Takes about 30 minutes from the airport.  Service is uniformly high across the hotel.  Rooms are small. WIFI costs extra but is available in guest rooms. The gym is very good and open 24 hours. Breakfast buffet is good but otherwise disappointed by the a la carte indian food I ordered here.   Stayed here for 2 nights on business and thought the hotel was fine but am not wedded to it for my next stay.
2277,It is the best hotel in mumbai must visit.I like the disco in this hotel also the area is excellent and sea side view is also excellent.Rooms are very clean and tidy.Also you will find ground floor a big conference hall
2278,The facilities here are top-notch & you can never be let down with it... Great hospitality of the staff as well to help you with all your needs...  Good spacious rooms as well... The price you pay is worth of every single bit of it... Enjoy your visit here
2279,"There is very less that you can wrong with the hotel. Infact there is hardly anything that one can point out at the Marriott mumbai. The location, room , hospitality , maintenance, staff everything is impeccable. The breakfast is in true to its Marriott style, extremely lavish. Even the lunch buffet is just amazing,theres almost everything on the list. The italian restaurant mezzo mezzo is a must try, if you love italian food.  The spa is does not stand up to the grandeur of the hotel. Was expecting a better spa for the kind of hotel this is."
2280,"I stayed at jw marriott on my recent stay for one nite on my business trip I was promised that I would be given lotus suite and my rate included breakfast but at the time of check in they said I m alloted some other suite and also breakfast is not included in my package,tried to convince the guy but he sounded helpless ,they better learn customer shouldn't be taken lightly also promise only when u can fulfill"
2281,"J W Marriott Mumbai has been a favorite place for my wife and I even if it is for short visits.  This hotel has maintained its charm for years mainly because of team building by captain in charge General Manager Mr. Pavithran Nambiar and especially harnessing young talents with promise to maintain the superiority of J W for many years to come.  We recently encountered a young associate, Ms. Neha Mulla, in Mr. Nambiar's Customer's Relations team during our visit in November and again during our visit in December.  This young associate is extremely dynamic and customer oriented with only one purpose....to serve the customer in the most efficient manner.  Young associates, including Ms. Mulla are more responsive, highly energetic, and very focused.  We as a customer get the highest"
2282,"Cannot go wrong - good food,great coffee,good security,handy location,excellent spa facilities and yoga classes. This hotel has a lot of activity and is very stylish. Well kept landscape delightful to stroll."
2283,"Beautiful hotel with exceptional customer service, great restaurants and lovely leisure facilities!!  My go-to place whenever I am in Mumbai; it never fails to impress!  The doorman greeted me by name although haven't stayed there for 4 months!"
2284,Visited JW again for a couple of days and this time they upgraded me to the Presidential Suite. What can I say? Best room in the hotel with the best views combined with the excellent service from the staff. Ocean view from every window. You would not want to leave. Best feature of the room - the high tech heated toilet seat that comes with its own remote! I am so buying this for my house. Bottom line - one of the best hotels in mumbai with the best service in a great location.
2285,The JW Marriott in Mumbai is a perfect setting that makes you think you are in paradise within the middle of a very busy city. Once you enter the gates you are a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city and able to relax and enjoy the ocean views and peach that JW Marriott is able to offer.  I was very impressed with the executive Lounge staff and offerings with special attention paid to the observance of local customs   Very nice hotel that allows business travlers the ability to relax while in-Country
2286,"This was my first stay at this property and I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed it.  The location was convenient, given that anywhere you have to go in Mumbai takes over an hour at the least.  The property is beautiful, service excellent and the food very good.  The staff were particularly helpful."
2287,"This is a five star hotel, with the usual accoutrements. Nothing to be said about that. However, service is very good and staff very courteous. The Indian restaurant is simply fantastic (try the guloti kebab) and the breakfast spread lavish. The disappointment is the hotel's own exit to the beach. Right outside the gate there was a pile of garbage. We asked the guatd and received a facile answer. Not good for the image of a hotel with so many foreign guests."
2288,"The hotel is at Juhu beach, about 30 minutes away from the airport. Rooms are very nice, clean and spacey. Hotel services are reasonably good.You can find a fine selection of cuisines at hotel restaurants.  But the biggest asset of the hotel is the kindness and friendliness of the staff."
2289,JW Marriott is one of the Finest Hotel on the Mumbai Suburb Shore.. One can see a Lovely SunSet from the room as well as from the Pool Site... Nice Swimming Pool with good accesories available on the Pool from the Hotel.. This Hotel Has got many colours of many Hours.. During the Morning lot of people come to walk on the juhu Sea shore which U can cherish.. As the day progress..within the Hotel its a Class BreakFast is available with some Lovely Gujju Delacasy.. Then there's is lot of Business Meeting can be conducted within the Hotel Meeting Rooms n hotel offering many services.. In the Late afternoon one can have the treatment in the beauty Salon In the evening the hotel is getting Busy with personal Business nd Love Bird Meetings.. Nice Buffet Dinner by Night...many many
2290,This hotel is very nice I have been coming here since many years I think its the best hotel around  .sea front property and the Poole is amazing . rooms are very nice but I think you should take the room which comes with executive launch access it would be a better deal service and the staff are great
2291,"The hotel is about 30 minutes away from the airport (all depends on traffic and time of the day), at a nice area in Mumbai, close to almost everything and had access to one of the nice beaches in Mumbai. Check in took some time until all paperwork was done but it was not inconvenient; quite ok. The room I asked for was a standard room. Internet is charged and not free but reasonably charged. The service was very good and the staff were willing to assist whenever possible. I wanted to go dine outside and they were happy to not only recommend the restaurants at the hotel; but also did recommend places around. I also needed help in going around the city and shopping, they were very kind to offer assistance and spent significant time informing me of the same. The pool is really"
2292,A good hotel if this part of town is convenient for you. Rooms are average size but nice and clean. Reasonable selection of restaurants and services available. Hotels in Mumbai are all about location so if the area suits you then this is a reasonable place to stay.
2293,"Just came back from Mumbai and the experience with JW Mumbai was gr8 !!! AKANSHA was wonderful and helped us in all the way she could right from check in to guiding us where to go what to do, places to visit and so on which was very helpful. Was booked in a suite but to our surprise AKANSHA got us upgraded to the presidential suite which was a wonderful experience. It's a fully loaded room or can we call it a mini apartment !! 8 seater dinning room, work place, mini kitchen, large living room and a cosy bedroom with attached bathroom made me feel just at home !! The only thing that upset me was the non veg smell in the lobby as they have an open coffee shop and a live counter for dinner !! Except that the experience in the lounge on their 4th floor over looking the sea was just"
2294,JW Marriot exceeded our expectation. Breakfast setting is amazing. The variety is refreshing. Croissants were the best I have ever tasted. Staff were always around to assist with a smile. The overall decor and theme of the hotel somehow lifts the spirit as soon as you enter the foyer. Rooms are spacious and comfy with a fresh feel. Indeed a superior experience. Will definately we visiting again when next in Mumbai.
2295,Rooms are slightly smaller compared to other Hotels. The location is fabulous and the view from the Breakfast restaurant Lotus is great. The buffet breakfast is good. The Croissants are probably the best in town. They are fresh and tasty.  Issue is if your office is in the other part of town the morning traffic is a big dampener.
2296,"Stayed at this Hotel many times and yet again the service was fantastic, they up-graded my room without advising me which was a fantastic surprise. The Exec lounge was brilliant and the mangers there are so attentive - Special thanks goes to Akanksha Sen and Nishita Dutt who were the most helpful of all throughout my stay."
2297,"I return here time after time. The hotel has a special atmosphere and the service is fantastic. We upgraded to a executive lounge package. Great value as this includes breakfast, evening snacks and good quality alcohol. We enjoyed the cosmopolitan cocktails! This is a top tip!"
2298,"Spices is hidden inside the JW Marriott at one end of the hotel. Nice Classical Mediterranean decor with friendly staff welcoming guests. Then it gets interesting.  Menu is limited - we had only to choose from a select range of 4 vegetarian dishes from each section - starters, soups and main course.   Large part of the menu is dedicated to set menu while limited options are available for in dine pref.  We ordered some starters, two soups and three main course dishes.   Starters were small portions and we got a tofu piece each - worked out to around Rs 200 a piece. Salt n pepper vegetable were not crispy. Soups, however, were good in taste.  The main course was decent - in portion size and taste. Pad thai was missing its vegetarian protein though but rice and Mapu tofu was good."
2299,"Marriot stay was good for me and I had enjoyed. All facilities are good and the staff is really helpful. The breakfast menu is good and you have a variety with the live counter. Location is also favourable as you can use the Metro also to hangout nearby. A good stay with the worth of the money spend, good place to enjoy with the family also."
2300,"I recently stayed at the JW Marriott Mumbai. The property is amazing and the rooms are very modern and comfortable. Our room was upgraded at check-in by Saif who was at the check-in desk. He was very professional and helpful and ensured a speedy and friendly check-in process. I have stayed at many nice hotels but this has to be one of the best. All staff members are friendly and helpful and are always available to assist with all your needs. The concierge was an exception, he wasn‚Äôt very helpful and we stopped asking him for help as he was starting to get annoyed and had no knowledge of many places which I found online and which I did visit and were quite nice. Usually the concierge is expected to assist with guidance about the city and the distances and directions and planning"
2301,"I stayed here for 4 nights on business. The hotel staff were excellent and happy to help with any requests. The hotel sent one of their new Range Rover's to collect us from the airport, which was a nice addition.  If you need to commute between offices, the hotel can arrange for one of their drivers to ensure your travel is covered all day.  The room was a little on the small side, but looked great and I got an awesome sleep.  Highlight of the stay was the breakfast experience - wow! Spoiled for choice and (from what I hear from co-workers) it's one of the best in the city.  We got to meet a Bollywood movie star and super model while we were at the hotel, which was good fun. Some good chat and pics!  Highly recommended."
2302,"Rooms allotted on check in were not as per our requirement, however this was sorted out quickly. Check in staff were very helpful. The rooms are well appointed and up to date, plenty of charging points, with various international plug formats. Sleep quality is great, the hotel is well insulated from the hustle and bustle from the city. Bathrooms have good amenities and house keeping ensures that accommodation is kept very clean. The breakfast is great, plenty of options for various diet requirements."
2303,"The property is in the heart of the city. While i've been around this place quite a few times in the past, i have not expected much from it. The property is spacious and faces the Juhu beach. The staff are quite friendly. The Lotus Cafe has a brilliant fare for breakfast and you might just feel spoilt for choice. Some of the rooms face the beach and it is quite something to see it early morning with the backdrop of the hotel's charming swimming pool. However, some of the rooms can have a horrible amount of walk from the elevator. So if you don't like walking, you may want to specify close to the elevator. Also another spoiler is the traffic around the area. But all in all definitely worth staying and indulging yourself."
2304,"I have been extremely unhappy with the response time and the service of the events team - especially Vanessa. My husband and I got married at the JW Marriott in Mumbai on May 1, 2014. After that, we were entitled to a Marriott privilege card. He completed the paperwork and was only sent a Rewards card. We weren't even aware that there was separate paperwork required for the Privilege and only figured out when we had gone for our six month anniversary dinner. We experienced a rude shock when we were informed that we can't avail of the dining discount. Neither Vanessa not her team bothered to tell us that some formalities were incomplete from our side. This is highly unexpected of a big brand such as Marriott given that we had given them so much business. It ends up ruining the"
2305,"We stayed here for one night and were pleasantly surprised with the standard of the spa facilities, rooms and the professional staff this hotel has to offer. Having seen a lot of luxuries hotels and resorts from around the world I can say this hotel offers amazing quality and value for money. Most of the interactions I had with the staff were nothing less than outstanding - they were patient, hospitable and extremely helpful  Good job on the buffet spread too!   The only downside for us was that we could not use the swimming pool area due to havoc created by crows in the pools and they do not serve alcohol based beverages at the pool side"
2306,Fantastic hotel right on the beach and great service. The gym and spa facilities are excellent and the rooms are spacious and modern. The art and decor in the rooms are really nice and I enjoyed the small mall attached to the hotel (although it was a bit pricey).  The food was pretty good and I defy anyone to find a more impressive entrance and lobby in the city.  Great stay!
2307,"I didn't get much time in this peaceful hotel - I arrived after dinner and left before breakfast.    Tight security to enter, as in many hotels in India.  The lobby is very large and beautiful - lots of marble and glass windows.    Room was clean, comfortable and had a nice view of the sea (tho I didn't get to see it by daylight, the full moon over the sea was beautiful).  Free wifi.  Since I had to leave before the touted breakfast buffet, I asked checkin desk if they could provide something for me to eat .. and it arrived in my room as requested, tho I was disappointed that they charged me for it.  Relatively close to airport, tho even at 6:30 am, it took nearly 30 minutes to reach the airport"
2308,"I have been to India before and stayed at the Trident and Taj. The service at the Marriot was unfortunately not up to standard. We arrived at 11am and had requested an early check-in but were disappointed to find our room not ready. After travelling for almost 24 hours we were exhausted and our requests were met with insolence and rudeness! Subsequent communication regarding cleanliness of room etc were also met with indifference. We had also booked and payed for a premium club room(incidentally for 6 nights), which online, states that it includes high tea. According to the hotel front desk(note:no manager) they had 'upgraded' us and tea would not be included. After many phone-calls between travel agent(indian legends) and hotel, still no joy! Extremely disappointing!  The only"
2309,"I had been there for one day for Seminar on Valuations. Amazing ambiance, perfectly fitting business meet set up, augmented conference rooms and very comfortable set ups and infra. Probably I found one of the bestest place to have business as well as other meets.  For a foodie guy like me, food always gets best ratings but I am being Jain I got many options in breakfast, dinner, lunch and all... taste is typical continental but I loved it.  Worth considering this option as this is at strategic locations in Mumbai Suburbs and near to she face...... so can be a good place to enjoy as well.  Room services and servings are speechless and have got nothing to say on it...."
2310,"It was the first hotel i stayed in during my business trip and found it worthy. The lobby is large and crowded with well-known bollywood stars at that time. Their buffet has a latge collection of indian, italian, middle eastren and asian food that are tasty and satisfy you. The fittness center is equiped with latest equipments such as cardio and body building weights. The location of this hotel in Juhu street which is a little bit crowded and this is the only disadvantage i can mention of this hotel. The area is surrounded by night clubs and bars."
2311,We spent 6 nights at the hotel. It is very well located with walking distance to local restaurants and bars including ones in nearby hotels. I would highly recommend early morning walk along the beach before the sun gets hot and enjoy fresh coconut water before returning to the hotel. The gym in  the hotel itself is very well appointed. Many eating places to choose from within the hotel... but is pricey. Cheaper options may include hotels nearby (such as the Novotel) or just a walk down the main street in front go the hotel.The service provided is truly 5 star . The staff are very polite and knowledgeable of the local attractions. Don't forget to watch at least one Bollywood movie at a local cinema (many to choose from) !!
2312,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and the service is excellent. I had organised a car from the airport and the driver introduced himself to me whilst I was waiting for my luggage.. When I arrived at the hotel, the staff had already checked me in a took me straight to the room. The room I was provided was on the 4th floor and included lounge access with meals and drink. The restaurants are of a high standard and offer a mix of cuisines. The grounds are a little old but are well kept."
2313,We stayed at JW Mariott for 2 days recently . All I can say is such a beautiful hotel and very nice staff . Its a really nice hotel with great location right on Juhu Beach . Hotel has access to the beach from the hotel but since the beach is not so clean we just enjoyed the view from the room facing the sea . Great restaurant and amazing swimming pool . Everything was perfect the only thing we did not liked was the size of room which was really small . We booked a executive ocean view room and expected a lot from room but the hopes were not suited small room and small bathrooms . Hotel is AWESOME but not the rooms as per what they charge for that room .
2314,"Nice quality hotel. Nothing special, but clean and things work. Pool area good be bigger. No alcohol served at the pool bar. Ask for BMW to get you from the airport :) Great breakfast buffet. Fast Internet."
2315,"The JW Marriott is a 5 star luxury hotel that overlooks Juhu Beach and the Arabian Sea. The hotel is open and spacious. The rooms are fairly small, but okay - some seafacing.   The food in any one of the several restaurants is pretty good - including the extremely popular (reservations required) Sunday brunch at the Lotus Cafe.   Enigma is the very popular nightclub where you can spot Bollywood celebrities partying with Marriott guests and young Mumbaikers well past Mumbai's curfew.   The pool area is nice but the spa is just okay - massages not the best. The best thing about the hotel is the Bombay Baking Company where you can get sandwiches, pastries, cappuccinos, etc. And if you need a special occasion cake, this is the place!!   If you are visiting for work in the actual"
2316,The first stop in an incredible trip to India. The hotel was perfectly located on the famous and busy Juhu Beach but safe in terms of security to approach the beach. The breakfast buffet was amongst the best I have had during my stays at various hotels around the world. All the Indian delicacies were prepared fresh while you watched. They went out of their way to fulfill my request for a Mumbai specialty Pav Bhaji for breakfast. The hotel facade from the front side is not appealing. However the indoor design is well laid out with the rooms facing the sea having a fantastic view of the setting sun on the beach front. The room was spacious and the service excellent. Overall a very satisfying experience
2317,"Have been visiting this hotel every year for the past ten years. Even if you are visiting the other side of Mumbai, I strongly recommend you take a few days out and relax here. Excellent hotel, my wife recommends Hari at the Hair salon. I recommend you visit the gym and get some tips from the very helpful trainer Shiekur. Poolside so tranquil  one can easly forget they are in India. Poolside fab service from Romesh, avoid the complementary biscuits with the tea, I am sure the will change them by the time you visit.  Our cleaner for the room Sardesh couldn't do any more, from great animal creations created by towels to pride in cleaning. Enjoy your stay."
2318,The Hotel ambience and atmosphere is excellent and guests have good welcome and attractive Lobby where you can discuss for meetings and good high security for everyone which is good. Food is expensive but good. The location of hotel is good where Juhu beach can be accessed easily with fresh air and environment.
2319,"JW Marriott by Juhu Beach in Mumbai is an awesome hotel .  Right by the beach and close to the International Airport.  The pool area is spectacular surrounded with fish ponds and water falls.  The Indian Ocean view is great, specially late in the afternoon during sunset.  The dinning area is open spacious and huge, offering an international breakfast buffet every morning with a variety of different kinds of cuisines. The restaurant is open 24 hours.  The Melting Pot is a great Indian restaurant just restaurant across the street.  For those interested in Catholic Mass, the church is two blocks away with an interesting history built by the Portuguese. Excellent business center. Excellent room WI-FI. Great room laundry service."
2320,Enter this luxury hotel and you can leave the crowded Mumbai behind you for a while. I had a very nice room with a view to the sea and the pool. It is not cheap for Mumbai but luxury has its price and it is worth the money you spend. Only the wifi in the room was damned slow.
2321,"This is my second 5 day stay at a great hotel. It is located conveniently from the airport. The staff at this hotel are amazing. Lovely sized rooms with all the mod cons. You get a great selection for breakfast. Restaurant options are fantastic at this hotel. We had supper at great Italian restaurant at the hotel. High standards at this hotel makes it an excellent hotel.The hotel is grand from the moment you enter. Friendly faces greet you as you enter. It is great testament to the management of the hotel that the staff are just awesome. The staff made our stay pleasant in every way.  Will definitely stay at this hotel again. Keep up your high Marriot standards. The hotel is ideally located for nearby suburbs like Santa Cruz etc. Great hotel, great staff & great stay."
2322,"Stayed for a couple of nights for Business at JW Marriot. The hotel is located right on the beach with a beautiful view from the rooms. The swimming pool facility is quite good.   Loved the quality of food and the variety. Their live section is quite good with chinese, italian, sea-food, thai options.   If you are staying at JW, ensure that you enjoy the gym, pool and the morning walk on the beach."
2323,One of the best hotels in Mumbai.. Very much liked by great celebrity's. It's a celeb spotting zone. You will feel very much relaxed by the ambience of the hotel. It is also a great location to be situated at. Surrounded by sea.
2324,"This hotel, overlooking the Arabian Sea, is a beautiful property.    And largely patronised by the Duropeans and the FAr East guests.   But in the last year, the standards of service have been declining on different fronts---maintenance, attention to detail, tracking of the Frequent Guests,  meeting specific requests of guests, and so on. While there are always very polite apologies and redressals, the guest looks for  ""first-time-right"" standards.   Hope the management would give greater attention to these aspects."
2325,the restaurants in there r relaxing the buffets r pretty good the food is excellent its value for money its a good hotel even for the upper middle class u can host parties in there on a good budget the staff r friendly the rooms r cosy
2326,"awsome ambience with tasty food love the rooms cleanlines and view outside and atmospheere i like,.nas.,dfmm;as;;mad;s.,mlo;sd,,,sodklm.s,oipa;s,.aksk;a,s;alsam./mapsk .as;lk;ams.a/spja/.msa.;mdopsjda,.mdl;"
2327,"Stayed at the JW Marriott for one night on a layover for a business trip. For the price charged, including luxury transportation to/from airport I can only give this hotel an excellent. The rooms were nice, the common space pretty impressive, and the breakfast had a great selection."
2328,We stayed here for two nights at the end of our trip and wanted to relax for a while. We did this well here. The pool is amazing and not at all crowded. There are more than enough sun beds. Although it says 3 pools 1 is for children and one was not very clean but the main pool is beautiful anyway. The breakfast was great with a fab choice of freshly made options (I go Indian every time but options of anything really). The room was well equipped although quite dark (I would agree with other reviewers on this). We had a deluxe double which was very nice but strange bathroom set up. The 'door' was two sliding partition walls and you had to go through the glass doored toilet to reach the glass doored shower. Not one to share with anyone other than a partner! I would recommend this
2329,"This hotel was absolutely amazing and the staff were also fabulous.   They all go that extra mile to make your stay special, my partner got an allergic reaction so I told the staff and they immediately arranged for a doctor to visit us. They also arranged for the medication to be delivered to our room.   A few hours later a staff member called to check how my partner was doing. The hotel itself is beautiful, make sure you eat the breakfast too.   The room was beautiful and the bed was so so comfortable.   I would definitely go back to this hotel."
2330,"Recently took my first business trip to India and booked this hotel based on a recommendation by a coworker. Outside of the hotel looked very nice, but my jaw hit the floor once i walked in to the lobby. The grandure of the lobby opening up to the dining area with 3 to 4 stories and all covered in marble was incredible. The rest of the lobby was just as good.  I was only there a few days and didn't spend much time at the hotel, but if I did, I would have definitely enjoyed the pools, beach, and restaurants that the hotel offers. Standard rooms were fair sized for a business traveler, but may be a little tight for vacationers staying for longer.  Overall, a gem in Mumbai that should be considered."
2331,We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my friends and found the best location. Best view from the window. Best food to eat in all the restaurants available in hotel as well as the drinks. Best customer service every where in the hotel u go. Sweeming pool is located next to juhu beach. Must stay if u r in mumbai and couldn't find anything best .
2332,"Everything was immaculate, flawless... Food was wonderful... Staff was great and super courteous. The ambience and crowd was the best it could be for a courtyard cafe. Sunday brunch is great spread of food and all neighboring table are occupied with celebrities most of the time. Many Bollywood and tv serials stars were seen"
2333,The rooms are well designed and exquisitely furnished. The location is superb and the staff is very professional. Floors are pristine and so is the gymnasium and pool area. Guests are spoilt for choice of European and Asian cuisines.   Well done.
2334,"We love the JW in Mumbai and have stayed here many times. They have recently upgraded the rooms which means they are much smaller, but they are very nice.  Ice cold AC, hot water 24/7, great food in the Lotus Cafe and wonderful hospitality.  The pool is great as well.  I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in the Northern Suburbs of Mumbai."
2335,"In a recent trip to Mumbai, I had not booked myself into any hotel and hence landed at the airport and tried to look for my options with the hotel counter at the airport. I was not sure which hotel to choose and hence decided to first try JW Marriott as I had stayed there a few times earlier.   At the lobby, I was received by 'Sarfaraz', a front office staff who basically raised the bar for all front office staffs in the hotel industry. His ability to connect to me in less than 5 minutes while presenting to me the hotel's offers was something that had tremendous amount of positivity and clear focus. I was very pleased to see his professional behaviour as well as his personal touch in trying to convince me to stay without actually pushing too hard. I must congratulate the front"
2336,Great place to chill from the noise and bustle outside. Great service and food... a great coffee shop with a hugeeee window overlooking the pool gardens and the sea. Great light. The only bad point is the pipped mall music that they play which echoes badly. The live music in the morning is much better. I had to tell them a few times to turn the recorded mall music down. Otherwise a great experience.
2337,"The service and food was excellent. The staff is well trained, polite and extremely friendly. The breakfast table is an enjoyable experience with individual attention from the chefs and the service team."
2338,"I'm a longtime guest at the Taj Hotels in India.  Tried the Marriott Mumbai this trip. Was blown away!  Friendly staff, great room with plenty of US comparable plugs, Executive Lounge was fantastic, great location with plenty of shops and food within WALKING distance (!), great pool and beach, and best of all.....there  a bunch of restaurants RIGHT ON THE PROPERTY!  Awesome food selection!  This is my new hotel to stay in in Mumbai!"
2339,"I stayed at the JW mid-September for 3 nights. I can honestly say that the service they provide at the hotel is the best I've ever had. And I am from the hospitality industry. Rooms, Breakfast, Executive lounge, everything was pretty great. I was in Mumbai for business so my boss and I decided to go for the upgrade, which I believe includes transfer from hotel to the airport, breakfast and access to the executive lounge with all day canapes and drinks.   Sometimes you can tell when hotel staff is trying to be nice to you, but they don't mean it. But the hotel staff at JW Marriott were really sincere and kind to me and even made some small talk.   I have another business trip coming up in December so I hope this time I get the chance to have dinner at that Spanish restaurant I've"
2340,"Loved this hotel. Stayed there for three nights and every single night was worth it.  The hotel is elegant, grand and beautiful. The staff professional and helpful. The concierge was thorough in preparing our city tour and gracious.  We stayed at the Royal Lotus Suite, which meant we could use the lounge (I always do). The lounge is beautiful and the service is fantastic.  The pool was nice and the beach outside the gates was breathtaking.  We woke up every morning at 6 am in order to go to the beach and be part of the hustle and bustle of Mumbai's scores of life, what an experience!  The hotel surprised me with a birthday cake on the 16th of October and it was delicious.  The hotel looks old from the outside, but looks cool from the inside.  Would do it again."
2341,"I was very impressed as my car drove up the driveway into this grand-looking hotel with its sprawling lobby and beautiful grounds. Check-in was swift and in particular, Puneet at the front desk was very helpful and rendered great service. While my room was nicely furnished it was a bit small and the seaview was from an angle (which is fine but maybe the hotel could clean the windows better). Food-wise, you can't go hungry in this hotel with its wide range of restaurants/cafes, from the Bombay Baking Company for sandwiches to the michelin-starred Arola for delicious Spanish tapas. I had dinner in Arola in vain hope of meeting some Bollywood stars but sadly it was not my night but I really enjoyed the food and vibe in Arola nonetheless. I also wanted to try some of the local"
2342,The hotel was very nice and the entrance to the hotel looks amazing. Room are spacious and very clean. The view from the hotel is exceptional. I very much liked this hotel and would definitely travel again.
2343,"My husband and I stayed at the JW Marriott for 3nights in October with our 22 month old boy.  On arrival, check in was swift and we were greeted with drinks.  We were quickly shown our room and baggage arrived quickly.  The room was large and spacious.  Our room had a sea view with a king sized bed and the bathroom had both a rain shower and normal shower.  It was perfect for us.  Breakfast was brilliant. There was a huge array of food to choose from and you couldn't leave hungry.  We were greeted each morning by Dvipal Mehta, the sous chef and asked if there was anything he could get for us.  He also explained he could make food for our boy, which he did on several occasions. His table greeting each morning added a special touch to our stay.  The pool area was lovely and we"
2344,"We spent just one night at the hotel and we had a pleasant experience just for a few things not in order. Negatives : The lighting in the room is too dark and depressing. The french fries at the coffee shop were stale so I reordered and the new batch also tasted bad. Not expected from a 5 star hotel. The weighing scale in the bathroom didn't work. Some of the staff was unfriendly. Positives: Breakfast spread was amazing, rooms are lovely and the view from the ocean view room was excellent. Overall not a bad stay just needs to tweak a bit here and there."
2345,"Ok, The hotel is not terrible far from it however my experience here would have me stay elsewhere next time and certainly not one of a five star hotel.  Firstly with the negatives, the hotel room smelt of sweat, clearly been cleaned recently and the cleaners may have left the smell in the room however this did go over night or i just got used to the smell. When checking out i was asked to sit down whilst a desk came available however by doing so they never came back to collect me and as such everyone just pushed to the counter next, i had to go back to the desk and make the point that i had been waiting for 15 mins to be served whilst others had jumped ahead. The hotel is clearly used for conference so very noisy and busy. I would also suggest maps in rooms to help people get"
2346,"Stayed here for over a week, sea view, great exec lounge and food was very good, and a lot to choose from. Akanksha in the exec lounge was awesome at just getting things done, shame not all the staff were on the ball. Definitely worth a visit."
2347,"After spending almost one week at the JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu Hotel, 1 Star: Front-desk staff ‚Äì Surly, inattentive and uncooperative.1 Star: Rooms. While the beds are comfortable, the rooms are dark and gloomy. Worse yet if you are assigned an interior suite‚Ä¶ it seems like perpetual night. 1 Star: Bathroom in suite ‚Äì There is a huge gap between the bathtub and door, and every time you shower the bathroom floods. What is even worse ‚Äì the ‚Äúhot‚Äù water is tepid at best.1 Star: Breakfast buffet ‚Äì The only way I can describe it as is hostile and full of contempt for guests. They use the cheapest ingredients and the spread amateur. 1 Star: Internet services ‚Äì Substandard, random and frustrating to access. While there is broadband access in the room, it is an additional 25R per hour"
2348,"By far this seems to be the best hotel in Mumbai, that too in the heart of Juhu.  Not only was everything available at a walking distance, but also very comfortable for a stay.  We arrived at the hotel at 6AM and were checked in straight away.  The overall feel of the hotel is very livery and classy. The rooms and facilities were impressive !  If you are looking for a relaxing stay in Mumbai, with a sea view and budget is not a constraint, my opinion is consider this hotel for sure!  Definitely look forward to saying there again!"
2349,"I returned to this hotel for the third time expecting total paradise as usual, but something seemed off.  The hotel is still as visually stunning as usual but the service was not as good.  One of the three pools had gone green and was closed and was emmanating an awful smell. My biggest disappointment was in the main restaurant, where breakfast and the buffets are served.  The food was less than stellar and the staff were both unfriendly and slow, we waited half an hour for a tea and a soft drink. Everyone in my group complained about the slow inept service.  I ordered the buffet so I could have the prawns and they were tasteless.   The head supervisor the day I was at the restauraunt was a burly looking man who wasn't friendly in any way, and I wish I would have gotten his"
2350,First time I stayed in JW Mariott Mumbai ... Pathetic service ... For any requirement I had to call them Atleast 3-4 times only then work would be done ... Car parking experience is worst of all ... Despite calling them to bring my car it wasn't brought and had to wait for min 20 mins ... In room service was worse than a 3 star hotel ... Will never come back or recommend anyone ...
2351,"Mumbai, or Bombay, as most people of the city still like to call it. I visited the city in September 2014. When you first land in the airport, you think yourself you landed in one of the most developed countries airports. A massive airport elegantly designed and decorated. There's a long walk to reach immigration, but a pleasant one. A free shuttle ride is available too for those who can wait. I  was walking and looking around on the wallpaper, the colorful statues  of Krishna and Ganish, and the latest ads of a Bollywood movie. Indians love their cinemas obviously. I reached the immigration desk, very politely the officer took my passport welcomed me to India, and off i went. The wait was 7 minutes on the immigration counter. The hotel arranged for an airport pickup, a stunning"
2352,Awesome Ambience & Service. Love the lounge and the beach view. Food is excellent. The staff is very helpful and would make sure you have a memorable experience. A must visit when in Mumbai. Especially the disc.
2353,I've just returned from Mumbai and my experience at JW Marriott Juhu was fabulous. The service was exceptional and the staff were so friendly and courteous. We had booked the Executive package so had access to the executive lounge which was well worth it.   The breakfast at the Lotus cafe is huge. There are so many choices and the chefs went out of their way to ensure we were well looked after. One of the chefs even brought us some Gujarati delicacies from the kitchen when he found out we were gujjus!!  We had a fanstatic night at Arola and Benson made it really special for us. Food was fantastic especially the patatas bravas..yum!! We spent one day at the spa and the girls were really sweet and the indian head massage was the best I've ever had.
2354,Service is special and food options are excellent in this hotel. The location within 30 minutes from both international and domestic airports is also very practical for business. A late afternoon stroll on Juhu beach which is just outside is highly recommended. This was my 2nd stay here and not the last
2355,"The JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai, India is indeed a Royal Jewel. About 7 kilometers from the airport, makes it an ideal place to stay when in Mumbai on business or pleasure. It is an awesome building with wonderful people. A welcome haven from the heat. The food is awesome, the rooms are home away from home. The service is world class. And it's well priced for a 5 star hotel. Next time you are in Mumbai try it."
2356,"I stay here whenever I am in Mumbai. Stayed here twice this September, The check-in service is very smooth, I use their car service from the airport to the hotel and never a problem. They now meet me as I enter the hotel and the check in process is nothing more than a signature and then they walk me to my room. Breakfast at the Lotus cafe is always great, after the first time in the restaurant they remember your drink preferences and bring it right away. Unlike many of their competition, they take security seriously and your car is always checked on arrival and you get the impression the metal detector actually works and is not just sitting there like many hotels in India."
2357,"The hotel is world standard nice hotel, The people who work at the hotel are charming and interested to know and ensure that you are enjoying your stay. It is extremely clean and the food was good. Overall a good place to spend a couple of days."
2358,"Stayed here on a business trip  It was an excellent experience  Nice sea view from the room Excellent breakfast buffet and very courteous staff  The check in time took bit long , but overall experience was great"
2359,"We spent a ladies weekend at this hotel in August. And we had a fabulous time here.  Our room was quite sizeable for Mumbai standards, the staff was very courteous and helpful (especially the concierge), the food at lotus cafe, Arola and Bombay Baking Company were excellent, so really I have no complaints throughout the weekend. If you are staying here, please be sure to try some of the desserts at BBC. They are heavenly! Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room with a sea view. Housekeeping and room service quite promptly met all our requests (and there were many!) There is also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel.  Check out was quite smooth too.  This is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the area. Although it's on the pricier side compared to the average 5"
2360,"We have stayed here multiples times and is the best hotel in the area.  The rooms are very spacious, the staff is wonderful and the food is great!!  The lobby bar upstairs has some of the best food items.  The breakfast buffet is also good with decent variety."
2361,Beautifull hotel with one of the best front office staff. The rooms were a but small but very nicd and comfortable.. Bathrooms do require some up gradation and maintenance. The buffet breakfast was very nice and had a lit of choices. The food was excellent.
2362,"Our friend had availed of their annual membership and so we decided to spend a Saturday night there! If you are a silver Elite, inform them , not only you get a room with a view but additional discounts on spa treatments. There are a number of good restaurants and we had lunch at the Lotus Cafe, Pizzas from their italian place and the restaurant spices has some mouth watering asian cuisine. Lovely and relaxing spa! a little expensive and I think they should offer some additional discounts on a group of 4! or even a couple!   Amazing Relaxation!"
2363,Staying in this hotel is an experience in itself. Located on Juhu beach the hotel is located amidst glitterati of Bombay. It's common to find television and Bollywood stars in the hotel. The moment you enter the hotel you know that this place is special. Sea view is just breathtaking. Strongly recommend food in lotus cafe which probably has the most elaborate buffet spread for breakfast and so delicious.  Overall a great stay!
2364,"Stayed for a week for business travel. Had breakfast every day, nice selection of food, fresh fruits, lots of fresh juices, great coffee.  Stayed in room 319 with a nice side beach view. The room was very humid (no smell though, just to be clear) but suspect this was the same across the hotel, given that we we're hear at the end of rainy/monsoon season. Other than that, nice bed, beautiful shower, up to date TV.  Service was fast, efficient and very friendly. Everyone always asks if everything is satisfactory. Strong security protocol to enter the hotel, including metal detectors and X-ray bag checks.   Had dinner at two of the restaurants, the Italian and the Thai. Both times, the food selection was excellent, seafood fresh, and superior service.  Overall a great stay, I will"
2365,"Call me provincial but I never knew Mumbai had a beach. The hotel has a great view of it; I was not there long enough to enjoy it though. The property is quiet, the service is friendly and professional (although I could live with less bowing) and the dinner and breakfast buffets were tasty and not as expensive as I would expect for a high end hotel buffet. This hotel exceeded my expectations."
2366,This world class hotel is located bang in Juhu by the beach. It is very luxurious with rooms facing the ocean and a private beach. The restaurants are truly outstanding- the buffet lunch in the huge coffee shop is top class!! Highly recommend this hotel!!
2367,"I stayed at this hotel for about 4 months earlier this year for a business trip. The hotel is in Juhu which is a somewhat popular area. Juhu beach is very popular with locals and is always packed. The street in front of the hotel is always busy in the evening due to this. There are plenty of restaurants and other hotels (with bars) within walking distance. There's also a beautiful Hare Rama Hare Krishna nearby. There are plenty of high end designer shops or get a taxi ride to one of the very nice malls (the malls in Mumbai are just as nice as ones in US).   I was there for a few months and changed rooms about 4 times. There was a floor that was noisy, it's the floor above or below the service floor. Personally I didn't like it. I always heard what sounded like furniture being"
2368,stayed for a weekend with family. the food is very good and so is the service. the look of the hotel is more of a business property. The noise levels at the lotus cafe(as for all Buffet restaurants) were slightly higher. The dinner and breakfast spreads are varied. The pool is nice and inviting. The executive lounge has good selection of drinks. The rooms are nice and cosy. overall a good and comfortable stay.
2369,"I stay at this hotel every year, I cannot find any fault in any department. They always treat you as a family from the doorman to the senior most managers.  Rooms are very good although the new concept is a bit darker to our liking. Facilities in the business lounge are great."
2370,"I have been member of the JW Marriott Club for several years. The club membership gives me access to the gym, pool site and offers a discount for food at restaurants. I am a regular guest at the hotel.  The quality of the premises as well the services have deteriorated over the last year. Maintenance is poor and cleanliness is mediocre. The beds and umbrellas are partly broken and look shabby. The pool site used to be nice, but since the renovation the depth of the pool does not allow serious swimming. Most of the pool area the depth varies from knee to hip. There is sufficient personnel at the site, however, they prefer to play and fool around most of the time.  The gym was renovated a year or so ago. The renovation includes new equipment of high standard and quality flooring"
2371,the hotek has good service nd also the location is nice..i like the food nd especially the coffee house is good..the breakfast is nice nd the staffs are good..was nice place to staywith friends..enjoyed alot
2372,"I went to Mumbai for a business trip in Febuary, the location was excellent , ambience & cleanliness was fantastic , overall a great hotel with zero complaints , service , pool, bars all very good. This hotel is not cheap but that's what you expect with the clientele & where & what it is. Will 100% return again"
2373,"We stayed in JW Marriot for 3 nights at the end of August 2014.  The hotel pick up was comfortable as was check in.  We were given one of the business rooms on the first floor. The room provided views of Juhu Beach, and was equipped with all modern necessities. The bathroom was impeccable and of a very large size for a hotel. Breakfast at the hotel is amazing.  The choice is unbeatable, from pancakes, dosa's, porathas to continental food. All in all a great hotel if you are looking for a bit of luxury and star spotting in mumbai!"
2374,Best place for everything from spa to honeymoon suite to excellent Italian food right near juhu beach if you have mariott card do expect great deals ideally located near prithvi theatre nearby foodcourts  Buffet is also excellent good hospitality
2375,"The disappointment of a ruined New Year's Eve and a planned memorable reunion and farewell brings a great sadness to me and my family every time we recall our stay at the JWMarriot. The time and moment lost will never return, but the disappointment does. What was to be a special and sentimental reunion ,Our New Year's Eve was ruined by the GM (Pavithran)and management.I look back sadly at a night that was planned to reunite sisters(coming half way across the world)who had not seen each other for 3years and to have it ruined by people in the hospitality industry at a property that I thought was a  perfect choice still brings sadness to my heart. My daughter was singled out and separated from her family at the time if the countdown and yet the staff and management overlooked and"
2376,"We stayed in a gorgeous corner suite while in Mumbai. Had fabulous views of the beach. Hotel was beautiful, clean, and staff was very friendly. Ate a few meals at the restaurant, food was very good. We were with the family, hotel was easy to get to after arriving from the US. Location was on the quieter side for Mumbai which we didn't mind."
2377,"For first day of Ganpati immersions of Ganesh, we thought JW Marriott in Juhu would give us chance to see a lot of immersions ... and we were not disappointed. Unfortunately, my child had an accident in pool, and we needed to first go to hospital for stitches.  The front desk manager was awesome help, organized car to go to CritiCare hospital, and the driver accompanied us all afternoon in the hospital. Finally, all was okay, and the little kid was playing again on the beach while we watched the immersions. All throughout the stay, the customer attention was very focused - Guest Relations execs like Neha Mulla and Poonam Chauhan were great. Of all the buffets in Mumbai (Grand Hyatt, Sofitel, Taj Lands End, etc) the JW Marriott is our favorite -- especially the Sunday buffet,"
2378,"This hotel is situated in Juhu, suburbs of Mumbai. The location is very convinient from both domestic & international airport of Mumbai.  This hotel has very premium cars for airport transfers. They have Range Rover & BMW for all guest staying in this Hotel.   The Food &beverages is very good in this hotel. Having morning breakfast in Lotus Cafe is amazing experience.   The USP of this Hotel is.  You have direct access to Juhu beach from this hotel. Most of the rooms have beach facing a f has very good view.   Rooms are compartively smaller but very comfortable with modern fittings & amnesties. You have JBL player in all rooms to play your favourite music.   Enigma pub is one of the finest in the town. Good music,  good food, excellent ambiance.   Swimming pool n gymnasium is"
2379,"Having stayed at a number of the Marriott's during my time in India, Mumbai has to be at the top of the list. The staff are friendly, helpful, polite and quick, while I again had issues with using a credit card authorisation form for my booking they were very quick to try and resolve the issue.  The rooms are on the small side, so a long term stay here would feel cramped, however the hotel grounds of the pool area are tranquil and relaxing. The view out to the beach was lovely and I could have sat watching the ocean and people walking by for hours while listening to my music on the Bose ipod dock. The bathroom set up is a little unusual but for the size of the room it makes sense. The buffet dinner was amazing, the variety of food was unbelievable, freshly made pizzas, Thai"
2380,"I have always admired Marriott worldwide for offering something unique and classy. Some disappointment however when u visit the Marriott Mumbai.   Had a Saturday buffet lunch at the Lotus Cafe. The staff is courteous and the ambience good but noisy. The menu is spread across different tables with live counters of Burmese, South Indian, Pizza, Stir fry, and waffles. Also had some counters of ""chaat"" the spicy indian street savouries. There is a decent spread of salads and very few indian veg and non veg dishes.   From the description it looks a huge spread for anyone coming for the first time. However, it becomes repetitive if someone comes back two or three times.   Overall good for one or two times or for family that hates to choose. At roughly $25 per person for buffet, it's a"
2381,"JW Marriot is one of most awesome place to stay for business and leisure travel and the sole reason for the same is that every time I visit the hotel the service standards keep getting better and better. A hotel with good facilities and location but the differentiator for this place is the team who runs it as they know how to connect,understand and meet the expectations of every guest. I am really impressed specially with continuous efficient and courteous approach of front desk manager Fenny Mathew and his team who as always insures that from the start till the end of stay is worth remembering.Another name which cannot be missed in my overall experience is Mandar Executive Sous Chef and the reason is his personal touch and involvement in everything that's gets servered in the"
2382,"2nd time staying in JW Marriott Mumbai,  location and room are ok.     However, as a 5 star hotel, services need to improve, e.g. - 1st day provided with 4 hand towel, 4 face towel, and 3 floor mat.  From 2nd day onwards, every time after housekeeping, the number always different, worst, one day no floor mat at all,  no SOP on this,   BAD. - at the restaurant, many time need to ask twice before been served, first time request alway forgotten.  It happened at executive lounge also. - Always need to remind that as a stay in guest, there is a discount for dining at the restaurant."
2383,"Location of this hotel is far inside a crowded area, hence making it difficult to commute. Hotel is great with a great night life venues. I nearly missed or got late for every meeting due to heavy traffic.. See google maps. I love the restaurants there. Service is awesome !!"
2384,"This was my second stay at JW, my first stay being in July. The stay was excellent, the hotel staff goes extra mile to make their guest comfortable, I was given an upgrade to a suite with great ocean view, Saif at front desk was very courteous, the staff at executive lounge were great Nikita, Amrita and Aamir to name a few. Overall a wonderful stay looking forward to visit the hotel again soon."
2385,"I recently stayed here 2 nights.  As a Platinum member I was upgraded to a Grand Ocean view suite which is very nice with sweeping views of the beach and sea.  The executive lounge is probably the best part about this hotel.  Service and food were excellent.  The Lotus cafe, or main restaurant, was good but not great.  Prices seemed a bit high compared to the rest of India.  Pool was great especially during monsoon.  The main pool is quite large and there is a separate kids pools and another large adult pool on the side.  Direct beach access is nice even though the beach is not that great."
2386,"Pros: Location possibility to spot the hot shots of bollywood. proximity to the airport and the beach.  good service, polite staff. excellent view from the rooms! Cons: food quality could have been much better for a place like this. Not a Quiet place. Always some party or another happening."
2387,"Stayed here for three nights on business and although the website makes the place look fabulous, the reality is that it's not.  Room (on the Exec 4th floor) was small, albeit that it was clean and tidy. The so-called 'sea-view' was a fairly small window out onto a limited view of the beach/sea. There is an Exec lounge at which (depending on the time), one can get breakfast, light lunch or drinks. Service here is good, but this is the first time I have asked for a pot of tea and have been given (literally) a tea pot with a tea bag, water and milk already in it ! Watch out for the OJ here too‚Ä¶..the sealed bottle I had was totally off and clearly hadn't been stored properly - smell before you drink. (I didn't and I paid the price).  The restaurants here are pretty good - both"
2388,"I absolutely love the JW in Mumbai. I stay here with my family every time we're in Mumbai, and it never disappoints. The staff is incredibly friendly, the food at all of the restaurants is delicious, and the breakfast buffet is unreal with its vast array of delicious options. They're also very accommodating with our checkout time; because our flight was at night, we were allowed executive lounge access after checkout so that we could relax before leaving. Additionally, their pools and beach access is also beautiful!"
2389,"My last visit to JW's was as always the best stay in Mumbai as went down with a few friends and made the most of our stay out they, the food is amazing as you do have a lot to choose from, and the pool side where you can relax and make new friends, after all of that you have the Night club where you can enjoy the night away, as me and my friends did, we love this place.....cant wait to go back..."
2390,"Hotel is located in Juhu Beach, which isn't super close to most of the business community, especially keeping in mind the jammed traffic situation in Mumbai.  That being said, once you arrive at the JW Marriott,  it is a great sanctuary with attentive people, nice rooms, a great pool area, five restaurants and very good service levels.  The Indian restaurant, Saffron, is excellent- try the mixed kebabs and bread, the chefs can show you how things are made .  The cooks and staff are excellent, and will look after your every need.  The buffet restaurant is great too.  In general, this hotel surpassed my expectations."
2391,The best place to relax & unwind.....Its a different world altogether....Food & Ambience are outstanding....Too many options to indulge yourself in ...Opt for Beach facing rooms as it has the best view....Pool is small but sufficient..
2392,"I have been ordering my cakes from the BBC for the last few years at the Bombay Baking company.  The quality of the cakes and pastries have always been consistent over the years .  The wide range spoils me for choices many a times. Overall BBC is a perfect bake shop and the best in the city, whether it is for breads/ bakes or cakes.  The Chefs always oblige in customizing my cakes every time, I  have requested them.  And my ocassions have kept my guest surprised and with awe with the finished product.  Great job.  BBC is simply THE BEST"
2393,"JW Marriott  has a very lively atmosphere. Everytime we came to the reception area, we heard sweet melodious indian music played on Sitar ( I think!) , while people dined at the restaurant thats just near the reception. The rooms were clean and so was the entire hotel and the grounds. The hotel staff had some sweets and fruits for us in our room. That was very thoughtful! Its great to have restuarants on site when you don't want to step out. The breakfast was very very impressive and superly delicious!"
2394,"Have stayed at this property numerous times and love coming back.  This was the first time I stayed here during the monsoons, and it definitely has a different feel.  Love the breakfast buffet...rooms are kinda tight, very nice folks at the front desk -- overall, very nice.  One piece of advice -- given a choice between having breakfast in the Exec Lounge or the restaurant, go for the latter.  The offerings in the lounge are limited (as one would expect)."
2395,"This hotel is amazing. The class and regalia you are welcomed with is magical. Professionalism as in most of the exotic hotels in India is bar none. The hotel is huge, bustling, yet once in my room I was quenched with peach & quiet.   The breakfast, oh the breakfast. You have to experience it to understand, Choices are limitless. The gardens just off the breakfast area are peaceful & Magical.   Hotel has  everything you need,spa, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, banking machines but you can walk out to the street to fine the same as well. I go for business but feels like a vacation every time."
2396,"i stayed here for few nights with friends. and its a superb hotel. J W marriott really keeps up with the standard. the location of juhu is also fanastic but my fav has to be the restaurant and the food there. will defi go back and stay thre, highly recommended"
2397,"Having stayed at other 5 star hotels in mumbai I was surprised to discover the JW Marriott standards, Despite the JW being considered top of the line for Marriott. The room was small and had a musty smell to it needed to be renovated. The shower door opened inwards but once inside does not have a handle which seems like a design flaw to me. The amenities were all pretty low grade down to the news paper bags act that are bottom the line material. The pool staff acted like you didn't exist we had to go get the towels and remove the dirty ones from the beds. Also I was with my few weeks old son and his pram and no one offered to help me carry it down the steps I am not sure they event noticed we were there.  Only thing that redeemed the hotel for me was the sunday brunch was is"
2398,"At a recent family wedding at the above Hotel, 2 Members of staff impressed me thoroughly.  (1). At the Lounge: Nikita Pal. - She was always smiling, & on a first name basis with me - Pleasant to converse with, I looked forward to seeing her every day - Perhaps all JWM staff should be of this calibre - She stood out to me, more than the rest  (2). At the Gym: A Personal Trainer - He immediately noticed a weakness of mine (ie. weak legs) - & suggested excercises to improve it. (running, free weight-squats) - I wish that I took his name - Sadly I did not,.  Both (1) & (2) are examples of why I would definitely use the hotel again."
2399,"I've been one week in the hotel and i have had a great stay. Professional staf, very good food, nice (but small room). Also a real nice spa, gym and pool. Only complain was the humidity in the rooms (because of the rainseason the room felt a bit humid). I was offered a other room, but that didn't make a difference. This seems to be a common problemen during this season in Mumbai. I've also conducted a 3 training at the hotel. The service and equipement was great. A beamer on the ceeling would make the rooms more flexible."
2400,"It was fantabulous  experience with. J W Marriott..we had lyf's best time with frnds..we stayed 3 nights in  J W marriott..we had smooth nd lavis hospitality by J W Marriott.nd awsm location in Juhu.it has lotus cafe ,spices,saffron restaurant with fantastic test..                                     We had spa experience with Quan Spa..nd had drink in Lounge which situated on 5th floor with great Arabian Sea view .nd also tasty food..whenever I'll in Mumbai I'll stay in J W Marriott..üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
2401,I had stayed in this hotel on 24 July 14 just for one night with an impression of the brand value as well as the magnificent location but i got disappointed when i found dirty bathroom sleeper and water was coming out during the shower from cubical. Hope this hotel management will take some appropriate step to maintain the value of the brand.
2402,I have heard wonderful stay experiences at Marriott juju beach.....I have been trying unsuccessfully for the past three weeks to upgrade my room to a suite or premier club room...I hope my stay checking in on the 31/7 for three days is not problematic ....the irony is that I am also scouting for high end hotels for upmarket clientele for a travel agent in India.....oberoi in Mumbai and shangri la New Delhi have thus far been excellent in terms of service.....moosa. dindar@gmail.com
2403,"I have stayed in this hotel around 5-6 times. Most recent was May, 2014. The place has definitely lost its appeal and the feel of a luxurious hotel. Although I would say it still ranks as one of Mumbai's top 5 hotels, they need to work very hard on improving their customer service. For the last 3 stays, I no longer see the eagerness of the staff to help you with various things such as bags at check-in, providing information, and other simple things which other hotels bend over backwards to do. The worse part of this hotel is the room service. Be prepared to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour, even if you are ordering just coffee. I really cant explain why.  I use to like this hotel because of the classy crowds and social atmosphere, but it seems not many people are"
2404,"This is a wonderful hotel, definitely the best in  Mumbai. We have always had an outstanding experience here. There is a well-equipped fitness center, fantastic  restaurants offering wide variety of food.  The swimming pools inviting. The rooms are extremely inviting. Large, very nicely furnished and with a romantic air. The bathrooms are large and beautiful with all marble and glass. The shower is  walk in with a huge overhead shower rose. Proximity to the airport is another great ++  in addition to its being right on the Juhu beach. Just like most five stars the staff is professional, very friendly and helpful."
2405,"Great, pleasant, and comfortable for a westerner my first night in Mumbai. Buffet breakfast was fabulous and staff so friendly. Live music at breakfast. Great pool. Transfer from airport worth it. Free wifi in BMW."
2406,I had an awesome experience while staying at this hotel. The staff was really good and friendly. I got a very good room. View was excellent. It was comfortable and cozy stay. Food was really good. Breakfast had all the varieties. Overall it was an awesome stay.
2407,"This hotel is situated at Juhu,where you get sand,Arabian sea,Beautiful scenary.Its just twenty minutes drive from Jug\u Airport.You will find fasion Boutiques,Art galary, and very tasty food continental and Indian cusine, more over Health spa,Wi-f-facilities.The rooms are enchanting.Its pleasure to stay."
2408,This has been my favourite hotel in Mumbai. But this time something was amiss. The BBC served water in dirty glasses. This was a major let down. Did not expect that from a marriot let alone a JW. Pointed out this to attendent and walked out. I hope the stay would be pleasurable.
2409,"Short business stay for 2 nights.  Upgraded at late night check-in to a large corner room, without any status with Marriott. Breakfast was a vast spread of mainly Indian food.  Too many choices to try even 25%.  Service was of a high quality throughout the meals. Free wifi provided to all guests, its says basic package but worked well enough for all tasks. Didnt have the opportunity to check out the rest of the hotel including the gym, perhaps on another stay."
2410,"The JW Mumbai was a nice hotel. It had a nice restaurant that was open 24 hours a day. Nice spa. A very nice gym open 24 hours a day. The staff was helpful courteous and nice.  The executive lounge was just ok.  Not an overly nice executive lounge for a JW Marriott.  Overall, nice place for a few days.  Beach stay away. Not safe at night."
2411,"Stayed here for three nights with my colleagues on a business trip during June 2014.The hotel makes you feel royal. It is one of the best business class hotels in Bangalore. The rooms and furniture are very sophisticated. The staff is always professional and co-operative to meet the demands every time. The menu is impressive and the food is just too rich and savory! Yet I found that the price that they offer was very competent to the hotel I used to stay and felt more value for money. All the rooms are clean and well maintained. And hey, I love the fitness centre and swimming pool area too! The swimming pool area is so serene and lavish, while the gym is well equipped. The wireless connectivity is quite fast in every area. The board rooms are elegantly spaced and have good"
2412,"I stayed here two times while traveling through India for a  business trip. The package that I had airport pick up and drop off as complimentary and they provide great, comfortable service (usually in a nice car like a Range Rover or Audi) to and back to the airport. Like all other nice hotels, the security is pretty tight going into the hotel.   The rooms are clean and a decent size. Also the beds were extremely comfortable. I pretty much experienced alot of the things that the hotel has to offer. The pool, spa, buffet, bar on the second floor, and the Indian restaurant on the first floor.   The pool is really gorgeous because it overlooks the Juhu beach and it has that infinity pool scene. Also, there is food by the pool but the only annoying thing are the birds that try to"
2413,The JW Marriott in Mumbai had the nicest room I have ever stayed in!  Beautiful and contemporary.  The restaurant options and food choices were awesome!  The spa was terrific.  The staff and services are outstanding!
2414,"I stayed in the JWM for 12 night earlier this year (early June) and I have to say that everything, from the airport collection to the drop off 12 days later was phenomenal. The room was great and the shower (one of my small things I look out for) was a walk in with a huge overhead shower rose, I didn't want to leave. Food in the restaurants was good (Italian and Japanese) and the breakfasts were great.  I had the unfortunate experience of being violently ill for two days while there (bad chicken I suspect, NOT from the hotel I hasten to add) and I was treated like a king, a doctor was called to check me out, medicine was delivered and I received a hand written note from the Hospitality Manager to ask about my well being. The doctor was great, and comparing here bill to the"
2415,This is continuation to the review of Renaissance hotel.   We stayed here due to seminar at Renaissance. We were shifted to this property without prior notice. When we checked in at night 11 pm they said our booking was cancelled. Which of course was a false info as they had goofed up. After 1 hour of constant follow up they gave us rooms and specially for female colleagues it was too much a wait. Even a foreign national who was in the group was spoken rudely. All check in was completed at 12:30 pm in the night.   Next day just happen to meet the Ops manager who apologized but shared with him that a person expects only proper communication and basic courtesy. Problems do occur but how it is managed and service is delivered is what people will always remember. Later he arranged a
2416,"Stayed at the JW Marriott in mumbai for the first time and it turned out to be a nice experience. I got upgraded to the club floor since I am a gold member.The rooms although slightly small were very nicely done...practical and pleasing,  The only thing I would have liked was more light in the room. The ceiling lights are spots and realy the room could do with more light.  The bathroom design and layout was innovative and very nice...made the room look larger ....and the lights in the bath were just fine. The service was great. Had food at the coffee shop and it was good.  They made an effort to check my name, the chef came to greet and the waiters were very helpful.  The view is really nice and the ambience great. The lounge on the 4th floor was also well managed and inviting."
2417,"This is a wonderful hotel, definitely the best one to stay at during a trip to Mumbai. The rooms are good sized, especially for Mumbai hotels, the staff is very friendly and helpful. It has a well-equipped fitness center with trainers available, nice restaurants with great Indian and Western food. It is pretty close to the airport and can pick you up from the airport if you like. Fast wifi in the rooms and lobby. Plus it's right on the beach so the view is amazing and you have direct access to the beach by just walking out the back door of the hotel. There is an Executive Lounge where the service is great and a comfortable place to relax.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to Mumbai for business or holiday."
2418,"Have stayed here before as well, but this time I decided to write review.   I was picked up from the airport in a nice Mercedes Limousine and the check in formalities were quick and was ushered to my room. The room size for the deluxe room is also very average. The extreme right side rooms offer a ""slit"" view of the sea and adjoining bungalows (yes Bungalows, in Bombay!).  To reach the shower of the washroom, you have to cross WC area. The washroom is really very small. If you compare it with Hyatt washrooms, its 1/2 or 1/3rd the size.   In name of fruits, hotel provided 2 oranges. The tea/coffee maker has insufficient quantities, but was replenished when asked. I had to attend a function within the hotel, so there was no trouble going anywhere. In middle of maddening Bombay"
2419,"We had a very nice short stay at this hotel. The food was excellent and the service first class. We were very happy with the staff''s professionalism and efficiency. However, when we went out to the beach we could not believe our eyes. The place was full of garbage, most of it plastic. We even found a syringe. The entire beach was like this as far as our eyes could see. I'm not sure what the issue is. Maybe the beach is considered government property and, therefore, the hotels along it are not responsible for cleaning it? Who knows!  It was truly a sad site, especially because all of that plastic could help the people who collect garbage and sell it for recycling."
2420,"Pros: - Friendly / welcoming staff - Hotel is well located - Nice spacious room with ocean / pool view - Celebrity hangout  Cons: - Lighting in the room was a little bit dim - Overall, stay was comfortable"
2421,"We spent our first night of our honeymoon at JW Marriott hotel (Juhu) We had an outstanding experience at JWM, Next day morning we were greeted with a chocolate cake,bouquet of flowers, and one sweet note(Its was surprise for us)..Too much variety in Breakfast.We enjoyed very nice lounge areas. Pool are was very clean. Room which they allotted us, don't have bath tub..me and my husband was expecting that. Bathroom ws quite decent, showering area ws too small. From my room, there is really beautiful sea view.. Really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend. I will surely revisit JWM again."
2422,"Mumbai is a chaotic city to western ears and eyes.  The Marriott was a wonderful oasis where you are treated like royalty and feel very secure.  The chaos starts directly outside the entrance gates (taxi drivers begging, no good sidewalks to walk on, cars honking, lack of beauty in the surroundings).  Inside it is calm, cool, and beautiful.  The beach is for strolling on only, and this can get a bit crowded in the evening because it is a favorite activity of many Juru residents.  The food in all of the restaurants was superb.  We ate at a different one each evening.  The one serving Indian specialties pris fix requires you be very hungry.  There is such a large number of dishes and you can have all that you want of your favorites.  The Spanish restaurant was especially good and"
2423,"When I think of jw Marriott, always luxury and extravagance comes into my mind, beautiful hotel.But the age had taken a toll on it.It's pretty old,the wood seems to have faded, some areas painting is required. But still this place is an area for Statement,celebs etc.for staying, the rooms are alright, compared to others in the area. But the spread for breakfast is,phenomenal still now. Service is great. Nice pool."
2424,"I went to this hotel on June 13, 2014 for work.  All I can say is,  bring out the red carpet because you feel like royalty!  Lol. The staff is absolutely amazing!  They go above and beyond to ensure your true comfort.  The rooms are a bit small but nonetheless, comfortable and luxurious.  I especially like the dual shower heads in the bathroom.  My room overlooked the beach (which is not the cleanest) but the pool area makes up for it.  The food is delicious! All Natural fruit juices for breakfast and a smorgasbord of authentic Indian cuisine, along with the traditional America style food, but I don't come to India often so I prefer to try the local food.  If you want to take a tour,  the hotel can provide a service.  The price differs between which car you take,  ex, Range"
2425,"This beachfront resort knows hospitality better than any other resort. As a Platinum I was upgraded to the Grand Ocean Suite which was simply amazing. The room had direct oceanfront views from the bedroom, bathroom and living room. Enough space to spread out and organize everything. The Concierge level Lounge was excellent. The support staff at the lounge was always willing to please the guests with excellent hospitality. The Concierge at the Lobby helped with sim card, phone, bags, tailor, etc. The Chef (Mandar) at Lotus Cafe was the ""BEST"". He was able to provide us with coconut water, and special requests for food on a daily basis. It was hospitality at its best. The breakfast was always amazing.  I will only stay at the JW Mumbai whenever we visit Mumbai."
2426,A departure from the streets of Mumbai... this beach front resort is top notch.  As a life time Platinum was bumped to a large beachfront suite... rooms are well appointed... service was excellent... would stay there on next visit to mumbai.
2427,"This hotel is one of the best hotel in india I feel this is a best hotel in india.freedom,support,membership benifits,rooms,service if any body tell me compare about that I will give gift 2 nights charge on that hotel.Mr.Sarfraj in front desk will help you like a friend. In hotel staff Mr. Mohsin, sushil, Sachin are very genuine over all this hotel is loveable...."
2428,The hotel is located on Juru Beach on the northern side of the city. It has great Amenities a spectacular buffet breakfast and a wonderful staff.   The lounge staff on the Congierge level are really awesome
2429,"I have stayed many times at this location during the past five years! This hotel keeps getting better! Very pleasant staff.  You must experience the executive lounge, it is one of the best in the chain. Great staff, great food, great views!  When you are in Mumbai stay at this hotel. It will make your visit a very pleasant one!"
2430,"JW Marriott is a super nice hotel with lots of great amenities including restaurants, spa and an excellent pool.  The rooms are very nice, clean with new technology.    The hotel also is adjacent to the beach.  The beach is not super clean by true beach standards, but it is nice by Mumbai standards.  I'd stick to the pool that is large and relaxing.  The food is excellent and boasts a very nice brunch on the weekends (Sunday).    If you're looking for a hotel in a real part of Mumbai (not near the airport) and, close to a beach with top class quality and service, this is the place for you.  Have Fun!"
2431,"Given the name and the perception with what I had visited the hotle, it dint met the expectation. No doubt the hotel is very good, but whats so special and unique it has to make a Wowww.. feeling was absent.   Best part was the areas near near the swimming pool and the view. Rooms are comfortable but small and not that very great.   Food is also Ok types. Never every try the pizza from the live counter. Its not worth.  All in all, good place to be but nothing so very special to pay such a huge price."
2432,"Fantastic location. Husbands office only 20mins. (as is Airport) Although if wanting to trawl mostly around Colaba, Fort etc - suggest staying down there. Commute to + from Juhu (unless u leave @ 7-730am) is an hour an a half, each way.    No buildings, towering over JWM @ Juhu.  Very Zen. Spacious feel, inside + out.  Grrrt Pool areas. Brilliant buffets/ restaurants.  Visit frequently.  Staff attentive. Rooms comfortable. Fab bathrooms. Though...  do not stay in rooms close to 'Housekeeping' - (their door 'slams-shut' night and day ! Staff sometimes chat the whole time while servicing rooms, late at night.) Nor near elevators. People come an go (often Midnight flights) + you hear those speaking loudly.   Club-Lounge works well.  Was an EXcellent manager (relocated... to an"
2433,"Stayed in Marriott incidentally on my birthday, And the surprise given by them is just so good... Very positive ambiance... Loved it all the way. Thanks to their lavish buffet breakfast.. its super awesome"
2434,"I am a Marriott member and must admit that unlike Marriott elsewhere in the world where I have stayed, this Marriott is very different in a positive way. The staff right from the Security, Doorman, Reception, staff at the Lotus Cafe, Spa are all very polite, warm and friendly. The rooms are comfortable expecially the bed-though could be bigger. Housekeeping staff are fast in reacting. It would be nice though to get Times of India as the morning newspaper instead of DNA. Staff in Lotus Cafe are very polite and always eager to get food for you from various live counters; it would be good to perhaps give some space to customers.The location of the hotel is great and one can easily access the Juhu Beach and walk in the beach.(I hear that in the monsoons there are floods in Juhu so I"
2435,"I actually decided to wait a month or two to let the wonder wear off before writing about this hotel, because if I hadn't it would just have been little stars and hearts in the review. The service at this hotel is impeccable all the way through. From check-in to the restaurant staff, concierge, to the security guard at the beach gate, everyone was extremely engaging, friendly and professional. The amenities are clean and comfortable and beautifully appointed and it is clear why the restaurant ""Saffron"" in the hotel is one of the city's best. Special mention to the staff in the lounge and to the chef at the breakfast restaurant. Rooms are not huge, but beautifully appointed and most have great ocean views. Good location for suburbs and Juhu Beach but far from southern tourist"
2436,"I was traveling from S. Korea to Mumbai with a long layover before my flight to Vadodara and  my final destination of Bharuch, India.  Our customer recommended the JW Marriott and was I glad.  The hotel and rooms are spectacular.  The staff super friendly and helpful.  The morning breakfast buffet and omelet station were five star as well.  Also, it is a short shuttle/taxi drive from Mumbai airport, very convenient."
2437,"Right from arrival to departure this was teh ultimate experience in hospitality food ambience and comfort with 7 star luxury experience .uperb spa to relax, amazing gym and a very relaxing pool with a view of the sea. Looking forward to our next trip so we can visit JW Marriott again"
2438,"The hotel is symbolic of the Maharaja-style architecture with compact, convenient rooms and grandeur that matches only the top few! This hotel is connected to the beach, making the beach views a stare-at-for-hours scene"
2439,The Excellent Hospitality makes you want to stay there and the ambience is nostalgic. Again the food on your table served and ready to eat is really what probably one would wish for on a holiday.Hats off to the management .
2440,"I stayed earlier in vivanta by taj & ibis hotels earlier in Mumbai. This time, on 21st & 22nd may 2014 , I stayed at Marriott . It was sheer 7 star luxury experience from the time you landed at the airport. Land rover, BMW for airport transfers was great experience unlike Toyota corolla in other hotels. Vast expanse of the lobby, dining, pool side are all great. Food is good in variety. Must consider a stay here when in Mumbai. Strongly recommend."
2441,"This was our second 3 night stay this year (2014) at the JW Marriott.    Our sincere thanks to Mr. Shah Nawaz who allotted us a fantastic ocean facing room (340).  He is a thorough professional who was extremely courteous and helpful right through.  Credit must also go to Ms. Arpit at front desk, who was polished and competent.  Marriott will do well to retain these gems.   At the Club Lounge, we must compliment Ms. Grishma for welcoming us again and making us feel completely at home.  She loves her job and it shows !!    Not only was the room comfortable with a beautiful view, it also was of a decent size (400 sq.ft.) Housekeeping could not be faulted.    The food and service at Lotus Cafe was top notch.  Joseph at Saffron was brilliant.   We skipped Arola this time as we found"
2442,"This is so far the best hotel i have stayed in so far in the city of mumbai.. Everything here was exceptional. Variety of cuisines to choose from, superb spa to relax, amazing gym and a very relaxing pool with a view of the sea. Looking forward to our next trip so we can visit JW Marriott again"
2443,"I travel to Mumbai every 3 years and this is my third visit. I always stay at the JW Marriott. I take advantage of all of their wonderful amenities - car service, business lounge, buffet, gym and spa.   Pros: - Short ride from the airport (which is gorgeous!!!). They offer a car service in a luxury car that has wifi. - Rooms have been remodeled. Marble bathrooms, huge closets and nice sitting area. - Wifi service in the room is excellent! - Pool is clean and offers lots of seating. - Business lounge offers a variety of food and the staff are really nice. - Quan Spa - offers a variety of great services. I highly recommed the foot massage! - Gym - has lots of equipment and staff that are willing to help you out. - Buffet - AMAZING. Great price for a large varieity of food. Staff"
2444,JW Marriott hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. I really enjoyed my stay here. I got a very good deal from online booking and stayed for over night. Breakfast buffet is a killer. Very good food and wide variety. Service is good. Staff are good.
2445,"Hi, I staying for one night two weeks back, My experience was great . very clean rooms ,I was upgraded to sweet. Access to Juhu Beach , Swimming pool and breakfast area are fabulous . Only one issue car parking is far from hotel on otherside of road.."
2446,"Excellent Food and room also, better than any other in mumbai, must stay, value for money also for the quality they provide   Any marriot is good but this J W is excellent, guys going mumbai try this and dont forget to take a sea view room"
2447,"As there are not 'boutique' luxury hotel on this side of Mumbai (or for all I know, any side of Mumbai!) the JW Marriott is the safe 'luxury' choice - it's huge and busy with the standard over the top scale: marble everywhere, giant foyer, and staff kowtowing 'namaste' to you at every corner.     I'm not complaining - I was completely comfortable- very nice appointed rooms, great air conditioning and lovely pool area.  Although there were work men in the hallway who seemed to talk nonstop at the top of their lungs which was annoying when you are trying to sleep off jet lag.   Room service food was good and delivered promptly. The main 'buffet' restaurant has a quite impressive buffet for breakfast and lunch at a reasonable price for the range of well done Western and Indian"
2448,"I had stayed there for a night but that one night gives you the feeling as if you are leaving in some palace. The architecture work is excellent. the range of breakfast they serve was astonishing. its the place mostly used for business but its very highly priced aslo. The location of the hotel is also very excellent. I had been to the disc in the hotel once couple if years back, had a blast in every sense. Deserts that they serve in one of the coffee shop on right after entering is just mind blowing. Rooms are decently spacious and service is also good."
2449,"It was about 6 nights stay at one of the best Hotels at Mumbai. A memorable experience with lots of positives. I will end up giving burger model feedback. First the good things, it is bang on at best place and center of anything especially its so nearer to the International Airport. The room was spacious with all amenities and the view I got was fantastic which had the sea and the swimming pool view from 5th floor.  The restaurants AROLA was very good where you have private space which can be booked in advance to have group booze and food. The Break Fast at Lotus has all varieties and they have very good space to sit and eat. Food also is good and has local flavors too. The service level at Lotus was not fine, which I complained and they were willing to correct and adapt, which"
2450,One of my favourite places ever beautiful hotel comfortable rooms etc but after paying over 20000 rupees a night I expect tha service to match we had transfers included in the room and on return we had the hotel car booked n still were asked to wait about half an hour for the airport and when they finally managed to get a car for us it didnt meet the JW requirements they had to hure a small taxi for us as they didnt have a car available even after confirming our booking! The car was small and the driver was rough and dropped us way ahead of our gate didnt help with the luggage either so unfortunately thanks to the hotel we had a  sad ending to our trip :(  Dhimant Radia  Date 10/05/2014
2451,"Great Hotel, super Service - everything is possible ! Especially thanks to the Team of the executive Lounge: special thanks to Agansha and Sashin, they organized a lovely Birthday surprise and Agansha's traveltips helped us on our entire selfdriving experience through south of India"
2452,"This hotel not only looks grand from outside but takes your breath away when u enter thier lobby. Rooms may not be the biggest but the ambience of the place and thier grand staircase did it for me.  Also if you a Bollywood lover, you are bound to see many of the stars walk in and out of this gorgez place on a daily basis."
2453,"Great location about 20 mins from airports, right on Juhu beach for a nice scenic view and walk. Close to good restaurants. The staff caters to your needs very professionally. On-site restaurants are amazing although pricey. The place to stay in Mumbai as a foreigner. I was thinking about Taj Palace but luckily I realized that is in south Mumbai not close at all to the airport and in busier area. Juhu and surrounding areas are really nice. Hotel is not too far from great malls or other attractions as needed. Would stay again."
2454,"Having read the ""terrible"" reviews I can only say that our experience was the total opposite, superb experience from start to finish!   My wife, daughter (9) had the pleasure of staying at here for 1 week in May 2014.  We had stayed her 11 years ago but must admit this time our stay was even better!  From the security staff; reception staff; bedroom staff and restaurant staff we were all made to feel very welcome, always being met with smiles and kindness.  All staff were professional and helpful, we could not have asked for a better service.    The hotel makes a great base, close to the international and domestic airports and not far from the various places we had to visit around Mumbai.   The hotel has excellent air conditioning with lovely grounds and great pools including"
2455,"We only stayed in the Marriott the one night as a stop over, but we did have the whole day to spend there. The facilities are amazing, doesn't feel like your in India. The best thing we found was that we wanted to have authentic food, and as the hotel is backing onto Juhu, we literally walked out the back and went to Juhu Chowpatty (5 mins walk) and grabbed food from there. The rooms are a decent size and the dinner buffet was the best I have ever experienced."
2456,"As a Diamond member of the Hilton chain I know how good, good can be. I arrived in Mumbai and stayed at the airport Hilton, a pleasant experience. Traveled the next few days on business and upon my return to Mumbai I decided to check into the JW Marriott. It is a stellar hotel with an enthusiastic staff. Simply put it could change the way I travel and the chain (Hilton) I show allegiance. The breakfast buffet at the Lotus room, the attention to detail by their staff and the variety of regional Indian cuisine is worth the effort to have even if you were not a guest. An ocean facing room is a view into the the universal quality of a beach,  with its early morning joggers and late night aficionados of a tranquil sunset."
2457,"We recently disembarked from a cruise in Mumbai around 9 am, and our flight did not depart until 3:30 am the next morning. So we booked a room at the JW Marriott Hotel Mumbai, located on Juhu beach overlooking the Arabian Sea.This hotel is not close to the cruise port. In morning traffic, the drive from the port to the hotel took about 1.5 hours. (but the midnight drive from the hotel to the airport only took about 20 minutes.)  Security is tight at the hotel, with each car being inspected and sniffed by the dog before being allowed to enter the compound. The hotel features a grand lobby that looks out over a lotus pond, the pool grounds and JuHu Beach on the Arabian Sea.   Despite checking in around 10:30 am, we were able to get into our suite ‚Äì room 244. The suite features a"
2458,"I stay in 5 hotels around the world and dediced to try something different on my last trip, hence my stay at the JW Marriott in Mumbai. this was the best all round experience, from beginning to end. The Staff in all sectors are warm and extremely helpful, leaving nothing unattended. The most amazing was when we suggested on the comments card that a breakfast item be cooked soft. It took 2 minutes, when the Sous Chef D. Metha arrived at our table with the corrected item, almost a dream for a quick reaction. I send my sincere thanks and appreciation to all that make these stays both pleasant and memorable."
2459,"Second leisure stay and was not up to the mark this time.  The check in was smooth, room and amenities were fine. But the breakfast and overall food spoiled the fun. It started with a long queue and ended with getting a table by the time the breakfast counters were shut. Managed to get some fruits and breads and a cup of coffee. To top it up the committed late check out time lead to an argument on the day of check out. Wasted an hour arguing and figuring out the right person which finally was given. Swimming pool needs some attention, it doesn't have that refreshing look now. The access to the beach saved the overall experience this time.  Now I am not sure if this Hotel should be in my list of preferred stay."
2460,"Modern hotel very clean what you'd expect from a 5*hotel nice size room big shower, staff very helpful, and comment questionnaires are given out for you to fill in they are acted upon straight away as we were given complimentary wifi couldn't get it to work the next day filled in the form and they returned in few mins later and it was all sorted. Very good selection on buffet breakfast Italian restaurant lovely tiramisu the best I've tasted apart from my own lol. You are so close to the beach that you can just step onto it through a door at the lovely gardened pool area. Good very reasonable Chinese/India restaurant  about 6min walk away past Starbucks."
2461,"Stayed for a weekend and it was Fabulous. The staff is curtious and helpful. Best part of our stay was the breakfast at Lotus Cafe. Simply the best in the city. Huge selection with great Quality food. Must try the freshly baked croissant. Chefs and the service staff are friendly, gives a very positive vibe in the morning. Overall great stay and lovely food."
2462,Only stayed a couple of night and overall very positive. The staff were excellent. The restaurants all very good. Breakfast buffet genuinely incredible. Car service very efficient and reasonably priced. The only fault is that the pool area and guest rooms seem a little tired. They could do with a refresh.
2463,"It is a great property with lovely rooms and view, kids enjoyed the pool. But the best thing is the service and hospitality which not many other 5 stars offer. It also has a great breakfast buffet... We just spent a day but it was a day well spent"
2464,"Starting from the quick check in and the wow view from the room of the expanse of the Arabian sea, the place is a treat for the eyes.. The room is done up really well too. But their staff at Bombay Baking co which is their  coffee shop are very lax in the evenings and one had to finally pester them to get us a table though i cd see enough empty tables! Also they took really long to take orders and did seem to have an attitude esplly when we mentioned we just wanted to do the fluid buffet (which was quite reasonable) .. showed indifference that we weren't ordering any eats.. later we ordered the eats and they were tasty fortunately! Next morning the swimming pool was amazing.. only a genius cd have designed it.. one can get in and get out from various places.. so much of"
2465,"I wanted to give a surprise to my wife for our second anniversary, but were short of time to travel out of Mumbai. So I decided to take a Jr. Suite at the Marriot and it was the best decision!  The room was brilliant and extremely cozy. The living room was smartly decorated and the bedroom was extremely comfortable. The juhu beach view from the room was mesmerizing. We had our dinner at their Italian restaurant Mezzo Mezzo, which made it a perfect evening.   The breakfast spread at the Lotus Cafe was brilliant and the service was attentive and prompt.   An amazing stress free day, surely stay here again!"
2466,"This was my 2nd stay at the JW Marriott. After the 1st time, I was tempted to write a glowing review, but then thought ""Why I am sure all 5 star, western chain hotels in India has to be good.""  Now I know... Not all 5 star hotels are good... The JW Marriott is the hotel standard I use to compare everyone else.   The staff is genuinely friendly and they will go out of their way to make you feel at home. Chef Suriya from Spices is awesome! Even though it's midnight, he still stays and makes my dinner and chats with me about my day and life in India. The chefs and servers at the breakfast buffet remembers my orders and brings me my usual, even on the mornings I try something new, I get double breakfast. They are always enthusiastic about introducing me to new dishes.   I went to"
2467,"Well my dad had booked a fantastic sea facing room. He is a club marriott member. The occasion was my sisters birthday. We stayed at the hotel for one day. Right from the reception, dinning, room service, gym, executive lounge the service is fantastic. I always prefer staying at Marriott's or Hilton s. And this is is one of the best Marriott I would say. We took the buffet lunch and buffet breakfast at the lotus cafe. The effort every staff member makes is fantastic. There is nothing to complain. They got to know it was my sisters birthday and arranged for a piece of cake. In the evening we enjoyed snacks and drinks at the executive lunge. The sea view is beautiful. Again the service at the lounge was fantastic. I also used the gym. It was clean and nice. At the checkout we had"
2468,"I stayed at this hotel on the evening of the 13th April and after my internal travels in India I stayed at the Marriott from the 17th-22nd April. Excellent service, excellent staff. Everything was great, however I do think that the coffee shop (Bombay Baking Co) need to sort out the customer service, I visited a years ago and the service wasn't great as well. Besides that it is my favourite hotel in Mumbai :)"
2469,"Hi,  I had booked JW Marriott Mumbai for spending casual time on occasion of my 2nd Wedding Anniversary. Confirmation Number: 86172425 The booking was done on 16th Feb 2014 for 1 night. While booking online I had opted for breakfast and asked for a crib along with early check in and late checkout. When I reached JW on 16th Feb at the reception I asked the lady that I have a booking. She replied saying - ""Please have a seat, will get back to you"". I sat at the chairs in the lobby/entrance and waited for almost 30-40 mins but no one turned up to ask for my reservation. I saw many other foreigners were treated who came in even after me. Me along with wife and kid and luggage were sitting with no one to attend us. Later on after 30-40 mins I again approached the front desk and this"
2470,Jw Marriott is a good hotel located in a real accessible area to reach airport and major hubs.Liked the appearance of the room and structure.Staffs are very co operative.And nothing less u get a beach just behind your hotel.
2471,"Apart from being a Marriott , it has an additional component of Convenience and luxury to it ! Right on the beach and a sort distance from the Airport , Its also very close to the eating and shopping areas in Mumbai ."
2472,"This was badly maintained, earlier.  Now it has moved up by quite a few points.  The rooms have been refurbished.  The decor is modern.  PEDs can be plugged in easily.  Breakfast spread is impressive.  And service is efficient and fast.  This is now a serious JW Marriott.  Be mindful of the traffic rush to business district on the eastern side as this is not easy to get out of, in the morning rush hour.  And also remember that entry is through the upper ramp.  The security staff are rude."
2473,As always top service. Stayed for 5days April 2014. Amazing service only thing short is a cigar lounge. The spa experience was something else absolutely amazing.the house keeping especially Sachin was truly amazing.10 out of 10
2474,"As a frequent  traveller in many locations around the world, the JW Marriott is one of the best in terms of all round service and quality. This week I have brought the family for a holiday combined with a bit of business. Nothing is too much to ask for with the staff and they don't expect anything in return. I would encourage a small tip where appropriate. Back home tomorrow after only a week. A real pity it isn't longer, but we will be back!   We'll done management and staff.  Jim Osman"
2475,"When I travel to Mumbai, I try to stay as close as possible to the airport, to avoid the traffic. I found JW Marriott provides the standards I would seek in a city like Mumbai. If you have also a loyalty program, the benefits are well recognized in this hotel. The rooms are clean and well prepared. The executive lounge is also very good and well supplied. The hotel has many options of various restaurants and excellent Breakfast Feast Variety. One tip I advice always when you visit Mumbai, avoid any seafood attempts...There is a next by famous seafood restaurant to the hotel, I don't advise you give it a chance (seafood freshness in Mumbai cant always be guaranteed). This is a personnel experience and may vary...  Overall, extremely professional & attentive staff members in this"
2476,"Efficient and friendly check in.  Got upgraded to a room with a full beach view.  Lovely modern room interiors although there's no bathtub. Breakfast and lunch buffet spreads are unbeatable.  Service can get overbearing but can't help but appreciate the enthusiasm and effort. Put a small negative feedback on a breakfast comment card and the restaurant manager immediately chased me to understand the concern and promised to improve the next day.  Also gave me a small cake on my last day with a farewell message, which was a surprising and delightful touch.   Gym is quite good although locker room looks slightly worn.  Overall, the best hotel in Mumbai."
2477,"I m feeling great honor to write a amazing facts about this hotel when i visited the same.... its been dream come true i felt most polite speech, behavior and mannerism of whole management team of this hotel..... they are very familiar to us..... and also enjoyed their services.... thanku very much for ur valuable support."
2478,"I is very nice and good hotel Studied in detail with taste and refinement. Clean, spacious rooms, buffet plentiful, varied and delicious offered in a wide area with an ambient really impressive. The advice we were very good. nice for staying 2-3 days...!"
2479,"A little bit of paradise in this hectic city.  Rooms- everything you need, very clean, extremely comfortable, TV and very clean bathroom, we had view of the sea which was lovely.  The hotel has lovely restaurants and pool.  Really did not want to leave.   Loved this place, I will definitely be back sometime soon."
2480,"I had the best ever experience of staying at Mumbai and all thanks to JW Marriott and its staff.  The best part about the hotel is the location. It's very close to the domestic airport and almost on the shore of Juhu beach. The landscaping, pool side and lawns are so beautifully done. The restaurants serve very good and fresh food. The pool outside is a real experience.  In the hotel there‚Äôs an excellent book shop which you can buy books and read them outside. Inside the book shop there‚Äôs a bakery shop which you can buy very tasty bakery.             The pool side has an amazing view of the beach it‚Äôs so lovely.The lobby of the hotel is so nice you can just chill there with your book or magazine. Anyway JW Marriott is the PLACE in Mumbai."
2481,"One of the class hotels in Mumbai. The best part about the hotel is the location. It's very close to the domestic airport and almost on the shore of Juhu beach. And if you follow Indian Bollywood, there are lot of chances of you striking one of the who's who of Indian Cinema... that's a bonus."
2482,I am Sachin Staying in Room No. 548 From Past 2 Days. There Was Some Technical Issue in Processing The Card for the Payment For Which These People Had not Waited For an Hour Before Which They have Deactivated my Room Key and when I ask about this to a floor Manager He Cant Even Speak Proper English And He says that he would get someone to sort this out for which I had to wait out of the Room for 15 min like a dog. Most Terrifying Experience I have ever Had while Traveling. I gonna Sue this People in Consumer Court with a Defamation Case. This Would happen in 24 hours Time.
2483,"This is the perfect place for indulgence.  I have stayed here with my family and we have absolutely loved the views. It makes you feel you are in another country. The landscaping, pool side and lawns are so beautifully done, we felt like clicking pictures of everything. The sea view is the best.  We enjoyed the lavish breakfast spread too."
2484,"This is one of the best Hotel located near sea shore of Mumbai.  This is very near to Juhu Beach.  Most of the Bollywood heros are staying here.The facilities provided are excellent.  Food, gym, SPA and other services are very good. Anil"
2485,"JW Marriott is the best hotel you can find in mumbai. It is the second time for me in this hotel. I really love it. So perfect hotel with huge lobby, has amazing location on arab sea beach. The rooms are great, i stayed in a lovely suite with sea view. They have different choises of restaurants and foods; italian, japanese, spanish, and for sure indian foods. In JW Marriott you gonna experience one of the best breakfast ever."
2486,"Jw Marriot is very well located on juhu tara road with easy access to town, BKC and other business hub, I stayed here couple of months back, very comfortable stay. Even when I'm not staying there I do visit  their indian restaurant"
2487,"By any international standard, this is a true luxury hotel. You expect great physical facilities and public spaces and are not disappointed, but what sets the tone for this hotel is the level of service. Just about the best balance of anticipating your needs and not being obtrusive. Great eating options - from the buffet, which has an astounding selection, to the Italian and then Spanish, truly excellent. Did not get to try the famous Indian fine dining restaurant but it is on the list for next visit. I travel extensively in India and I would not hesitate to return to this hotel.  If I had to pick some minor gripes (it's difficult!), it is a bit further away from the downtown business hubs (but the extra travel is worth it for the local setting on Juhu Beach) and if you like to"
2488,Stayed at the Marriott Hotel Juhu and was not disappointed . Classy hotel . Excellent service . Staff are all courteous - especially the catering and the front reception. Ambiance is great and the view from the room was beautiful. Only toilet paper in the toilet ??? This is India for goodness sake ! I had a problem with two things 1 The pillows- so many but none hard enough and pillows are not supposed to be square  2. Far too many light switches ! ALL in all  good stay.
2489,"I stayed at the JW Marriott for two nights.  By far the best hotel by location it's in a very glamorous location of Mumbai - Juhu. Staff well trained (Marriott does have the best training). Staff very welcoming, they smiled and really made you feel at home. The hotel from the outside gave you the experience of driving into a palace. What I liked about this hotel is that safety is important I also absolutely loved how you were greeted by security staff when doing a car check (such fun, it added to the experience - thanks for the namaste). The space was fabulous to I just wanted to dance around the hotel which you can do in the many nightspots in the hotel bars, etc. Food was to die for. Rooms amazing loved the decor. I could keep writing and give so many examples of the great"
2490,"My friend chose the lunch buffet to celebrate her birthday with us.  They stored and brought out her birthday cake at the end.  Great choice of both veg and non veg items, all very good quality except for the Maggi kind of noodles being served there too!  Apparently they are popular...Really enjoyed the delicious chat, laksi soup was out of the world, hot and steamy,  I chose shrimps, mushrooms and some other thinly sliced veggies to put into the base.  Salads were extremely well presented and tasted fresh and crunchy. Everyone enjoyed their lunches.  My friend has been there many times for their even better dinner buffet, nice treat when one is out of town!"
2491,"As a family, this was our first time in Mumbai and we were very nervous. But this hotel made our trip one of the most amazing experiences for me and the kids. Apart from its amazing facilities, the service in this hotel was absolutely outstanding. From the minute we came in, Ganeshram Iyer, the front Office manager, was extremely accommodating and kind. Knowing how far we came from, he was so hospitable and came to check back on us many times and took the time to talk to us. He truly made sure we were comfortable and happy. Another person who really took the time to serve us was Sous Chef Mehta from the Lotus restaurant who always asked if we were comfortable, was very hospitable, and brought us new foods for us to try. One of our concerns in India was the reputation of the food"
2492,"Stayed at hotel for a week with family, hard to fault anything. Amazing breakfast buffet. Great restaurants throughout hotel. Excellent pools and gym/spa. Service from staff could not be faulted. Concierge arranged slum tour for us which was excellent. By Mumbai standards only a short drive from airport."
2493,It is nice hotel with good sight of Mumbai.Great Food and Room Service .Highly recommended and excellent value for money.I will certainly stay again. An excellent selection of condiments. Good phone service and internet access.
2494,"I was there for three nights and the experience was great.The staff is extremely courteous and very helpful.The food in the Lotus Cafe and other restaurants is great.The only issue was a very very long walk to my room on the first floor,it could be irritating at times,and very few channels to flick through on television (strange),overall a very good experience ,planning to visit again soon."
2495,I had planned a trip to Mumbai along with wife and 1 year old son.  This was meant to be leisure plus a bit of business.  We lived in Mumbai many years ago so had many hotels in mind but we thought of choosing JW Marriott since it was near our old house etc. and friends in the neighbourhood.  Hotel arranged for a great car to pick us up at 5 a.m. at the airport with good staff.  We reached the hotel at 5:30 a.m. or so and my son went into a seizure!  We were just at the reception at that time and it is the scariest thing since he just stops responding to everything when this happens.  This has happened before so we carry his emergency medicine but for some reason even they weren't working.  We made him lie on the lobby sofas and turned the place into a small emergency room but
2496,I stayed in Feb & March both times on business and the service was impeccable both times. The sea facing rooms are really great and the view during sunset is breathtaking. Breakfast and all other meals were excellent.
2497,"Hotel is best in class, services offered were great, I went there last week of feb-14, it's not just good its best among indian hotels I have visited so far, food was excellent and nicely decorated on plates, test were amazing. Rooms were picture perfect and we enjoyed stay there with my family."
2498,"I was there for three nights and the experience was great. The service and food was excellent. The staff is well trained, polite and extremely friendly. The breakfast table is an  enjoyable experience with individual attention from the chefs and the service team."
2499,"Ambience , cleanliness etc everything is so perfect and well suited. The food is so delicious and rooms are so stylish with all latest and upgraded amenities. Airport transfers were included in my booking and that was quite comfortable..overall my stay was excellent"
2500,Rooms are well appointed with all the latest amenities. perfect Marriott stay and lived up to the brand. The servise extremely good and the hygiene taken extreme care of. I went there for business trip and all my colleagues had the same experience. The food quality can be improved though.
2501,"I stayed with the hotel for a night on 10th of March, on my way back from a foreign trip.  Airport transfers were included in my bookings. I had to collect some documents from some place near the airport for which i requested to take me to the airport via Malad. I was told that any deviation from the regular airport route no matter how small would be chargeable.  Mr. Vijay from Concierge promised me a luxury vehicle also charged me Rs.2500 for the same (in spite of my free airport drop).  But they landed me with an old Toyota Camry which was very dirty (seats, upholstry, mats). Basically the whole car was a mess.  Upon complaining our chauffeur Mr. Neville could only say a sorry and that the hotel people had given the wrong car by mistake and he could not do anything about it."
2502,"all in one - food, value for money, location, service. couldn't have asked for more. the food spread is great. Rooms are well appointed with all the latest amenties. perfect Marriott stay and lived up to the brand"
2503,"it was an awesome stay.. the staff is just exceptional.. professional , smart , obliging and great willingness with every attention to detail.. the room was fantastic..the breakfast was superb.. its a mind blowing property with a beautiful sea view"
2504,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The structure, decor and ambiance are outstanding. From the moment you walk into the hotel to the reception the rooms the lounges, the outside ""water front"" area, all is outstanding. The service is outstanding with all personnel really trying to make your stay a pleasure. Their breakfasts are absolutely amazing Definitely a must stay in Mumbai"
2505,Stupendous Hotel Enjoyed stay never felt like leaving it Neat clean courteous and value hotel in Mumbai Looking forward to staying in tge property I have stayed in longtime Apt for business leisure family again
2506,One best sea facing hotel in city of Mumbai. Amazing atension to detail to design the lobby.sea view both while entering lobby and if book sea facing room give real refreshing stay.i fall in love with bathroom . Closet space is good.juhu beach may not great location those l  E to downtown Mumbai . But certainly.this  hotel and friendly staff will give comfort feeling. One must try jw at juhu best value for money
2507,Attended an event organisers meet  Presentation was great   Food was spectacular   Live counters dished out delicious   Thai curry  Mumbai  local Pasta   Guava mock tail was superb too   Service was prompt   Bartender was funky suiting the occasion   Well done
2508,"It's truly a lovely hotel with Excellent rooms and services and top notch amenities.The staff is very warm and always helpful. Fantastic restaurants with a wide variety.Our stay was very comfortable and has been a wonderful experience. I would recommend this as the best 5 star hotel bcoz of its ambience, services, food and the helpful and courteous staff."
2509,"Today I plan with my friend to get a couple of drinks in Arola bar at about 11:50, the bar is one of the listed hotel facility working from 18:30 to 01:00. Unfortunately, waiter stopped us from getting in due to the facility being reserved for birth day party. I've asked for the hotel manager and he stated the same. By the way this is the only facility available that time attached with smoking area  Just want to know, how come that hotel resident being stopped from using hotel facility. As far as we all know internationally, that the room rate level is based on the facilities provided to the resident for his satisfaction."
2510,"This hotel has top notch security, gorgeous and clean facilities and safe water and food. Lobby is absolutely stunning, elevators and hallways are spotless and well appointed. Rooms with Electronic Key (not needing to be inserted into door) access are absolutely amazing. Nice size, bathroom and Rain Showers. Beds are only downfall, not very comfortable and sheets not fitted well, having been to the hotel many many times, this is a consistent issue. Sent Dry Cleaning out and returned next day without Collar Stays, asked for replacement collar stays and never delivered, asked front desk, waited a half hour and then left after no response. Breakfast is absolutely delicious and service top notch. Multiple swimming pools to choose from with absolutely beautiful surroundings and"
2511,"Spent a week here for work. Truly a lovely hotel. Brand new rooms, excellent service, top notch amenities. Fitness center is spacious and well stocked with exercise equipment for business travelers trying to stay in shape. Pool and surrounding garden is an oasis in the middle of Mumbai. Fantastic breakfast buffet and the morning concierge was able to fulfill every request we had, a special mention to the driver we used for the week - Tajinder, ask for him if you can. Ate dinner at two of the restaurants, Arola and Saffron. Do the Indian tasting menu at Saffron, truly a great experience. Also, special mention to staff at Bombay Baking Company for knowing my cappuccino order in the mornings."
2512,"My Husband and i traveled extensively around the world but have never before experience such superb customer service as did your hotel during our stay.in particular we were absolutely delighted your Assistant front office manager Ganeshram lyer. .He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable as without even breaking his smile for even a second ,and while this had us thinking that there is no way to top such exceptional service we were state of true disbelief when Ganeshram  offered us a free upgrade to your executuve room due to the fact that  i was first time guest at your hotel and India  .its been a few days and we aew back in oman but we can wipe the smile off our faces Ganesram is truly an assest to your superb hotel and it is because of service excellence like this"
2513,Hotel is superb with very helpful staff. Must mention ranjit in lotus restaurant. He was the best. He especially made pau bhaji and wada pau for breakfast for me even when they were not on the menu. Also Akhil was very helpful. Nandu in housekeeping was very good. In fact everyboby was very nice always saying Namaste - makes such a difference. The only thing I missed was a douche in the toilet. Will definitely come back
2514,"Travelled on business and this hotel was booked for me and colleagues specifically with an early check in. Unfortunately when we arrived at 1pm our rooms were not ready, after an overnight flight, and a meeting 45 mins across the city to get to this was not the best start to our trip. The staff, whilst text book apologetic did not do anything over and above to ensure we got the early check in we had paid for. The hotel itself was immaculate, and all staff were extremely friendly, helpful and polite. My room, over looking the beach, was spotless, with a fabulous shower, and I was very happy to see proper coffee and a coffee press! Clearly the staff looking after my room were very attentive, providing extra coffee and bottled water (on top of the normal allowance)  The facilities"
2515,"The hotel is absolutely fantastic. The property is just beautiful, and the staff are very warm and always helpful. You just can't go wrong if you decide to stay here for business or pleasure. If you're an elite Marriott member, you also get a lot of extra perks at this hotel."
2516,I stayed there twice this trip. 9 days in total. Sweta front desk was excellent.  Lotus restaurant was  Very good. House keeping was excellent. I have stayed at this property previously. It's got even better.
2517,"The biggest mistake i ever did was gifting my friends their first wedding night at this hotel.   Whats the point of the staff being courteous after they have already made the blunder and ruined it for the guest? I reserved a room with a honeymoon package for my friends to enjoy their night, which was not an easy task, given the no. of times your call is transferred to different sections and different no. of people. At the time of the reservation, I made myself very clear (of which they also took a note) that it is a ""GIFT"" for the guests who would be coming in, and the entire payments for the stay will be made by me, for which i had provided them with my credit card details.  After having checked multiple times and getting assurance from the team, upon arrival, my friend was"
2518,We stayed in a group for marriage the moment entering the lobby you could see the swimming pool and the beach.. Check in was smooth ... Luggage delivery was prompt... fantastic spread of  Breakfast ... wanted to use the spa but couldn't to time... may be next time... Will stay again..
2519,The Desserts here are to die for.  Great service and ambience with views and fabulous food options.  I personally love JW Marriot Mumbai and its a beautiful hotel. The pool side has just amazing views. Classy hotel all around.
2520,Was recently at the JW Marriott - Mumbai on a business trip. The hotel is now a legend in Mumbai and needs no introduction. I just wanted to make a mention of the fantastic breakfast buffet spread. The coffee in BBC is still to die for - the Starbucks across the road was a huge let-down the coffee there wasn't there.... I personally love the JW Marriott Mumbai and love going back there. They sure do a fantastic job. The newly renovated rooms are extremely well appointed and speak miles of the charm of the place.
2521,"One of my best stay experiences at a luxury hotel so far. Cordial staff, excellent room service. Special mention to the staff at the gym for their nice demeanor  Must commend on the wide of array of cuisines as part of the buffet arrangement. A God-sent especially for foreigners with different culinary tastes. Vegetarians have a lot of options too.   Looking forward to being there sometime soon."
2522,Excellent facility in the heart of Bollywood.  Very clean hotel with fabulous food options and great ocean and beach views.  Beautiful courtyards.  Beach is right in the backyard!  Just walk to the beach and ocean!  Classy hotel all round.
2523,"The check in process was smooth and efficient , we checked in on the 7th of  FEB and stayed here for 2 nights to attend a wedding  ceremony , right from airport pick to the check in at our room on the second flow with ocean view was quite good . The property has been well maintained and probably to find such a huge property in Mumbai and that to on the ocean is great , the swimming pool was just awesome . The  quality of food was quite  decent ., the everyday break fast was quite impressive. The room though are of smaller size but then very comfortable , I would defiantly recommended this hotel if you are coming to Mumbai as it will give you the feeling as you are staying in a resort and not a business hotel."
2524,"Check in was smooth and efficient. Room was on executive floor (4rth floor). The room was small but space efficient. The ocean view was limited. Service was attentive. Large buffet area in centre of hotel with wide selection of food, but lacking ambiance. Pool was nice and the pool chairs were comfortable. Seems like they are trying to provide both ""international"" and ""local indian"" amenities and services, but in eying to be all things to all people, have become very generic."
2525,"It was really pampering and good stay with hotel and food quality was awesome. Love to stay again in next visit. A pleasant stay for couple and family I would recommend. Breakfast, spa and all facilities ."
2526,"well JW Marriott is good place is stay, staff are polite, attentive and they really treat you very well. room is ok not so big. Restaurant Service is excellent, their food and service is great. Hotel is very clean."
2527,"Amazing service, Good view and excellent privacy. Good hotel with nice restaurants. Highly recomended. great location , on main juhu beach . Good gym and spa facilities. Friendly staff.must visit ...."
2528,"Good hotel with nice restaurants. Highly recomended. Breakfast was excellant, lots to choose from. Good gym and spa facilities. Friendly staff. They have brunch on every sunday for set price. Lots of varieties to choose from, family friendly atmosphere."
2529,"Obviously staying in a high end five star, Amazing service, Good view and excellent privacy. Provided complimentary pastries and mini cakes. Awesome gym facilities and equipments and friendly staff. They often have theme based arrangements in their food area promoting regional tourism. Room service food menu was a bit of disappointment, otherwise excellent stay experience!!!!"
2530,"Stayed there on Feb 5, and found that  1.  the washbasin tap marked 'cold"" was pouring out steaming hot water (thankfully hand not scalded !)    2.  The coffeemaker was not working doe to electrical fault--and shortly after a 20-minute repair work by the electrical maintenance staff, by around 22.00 hrs, I found that the lights in the room/corridor/bath/wash areas could not be switched off at all !  Needing to sleep early after a long day, and not wishing to  risk another 20-30 minute fiddling by electricians, I went to sleep with the lights on throughout the night ( the only option was to pull out the room key from the master control point near the door, and not be able to switch on even the bedside  light without walking to the door again!) .   Thankfully, the food at"
2531,"100% recommend this place.  The Bar, the Italian, the Asian (Sushi is average but rest is great) restaurants are wonderful. The breakfast is great. No question is Hotel is all around super. Even Bollywood stars stay here. :) Staff is helpful and friendly."
2532,"I stayed here recently while attending a business meeting. At the time of check in, I was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to suite - a very nice gesture; my only quibble was that it wasn't on a higher floor so the view was not that great. The suite had a large living room along with a bedroom next door. Each room had its own TV and a bathroom. But the bed was the best part - its been a while since I slept well in a hotel and this bed did it for me. Breakfast was a large buffet spread with far too many options. The property is right on the beach and also has an excellent swimming pool."
2533,"We stayed in Holiday Inn Mumbai whilst our stay in Mumbai, but had a night here in JW Marriott! World class grandeur! Lobby was amazingly huge. We had dinner in their cafetaria and my god, never seen a  bigger scene! The buffet selection varied from western, to asian to Mediterranean! And of course was of fine quality. Staff service was quick and efficient! Pool was beautiful and hotel was facing the Juhu Beach! Like any other 5 star plus more!! Thumbs up!!"
2534,"Our stay at this hotel was fantastic! We had a great time mainly because of the first-class service. Each and every employee is courteous and attentive to the needs of guests. They go out of the way to make you feel important and to take care of your needs. At the end of the stay, we felt connected with the staff. They were down to earth and friendly.    The breakfast at Lotus Cafe is amazing! One of the best breakfasts at a hotel...I might even say the best we have had so far (and we travel quite a bit). It takes a few days to try everything...that is how vast the selection is. Also, if you want something in particular, the staff prepare it for you right away.  The room itself is small but sufficient. The room was updated and modern. The beds are large. We had a two double"
2535,"We like this hotel. Last year we stayed here on the way in and the way out of India, and we did the same this year (2013). It's nice to experience some luxury prior to diving into the wonderful chaos that is India, and also to wind down before flying home. Another advantage is leaving all our Mumbai shopping at the hotel and picking it up on the way back. The executive lounge is particularly good, one of the best, with great food and drink and really helpful and friendly staff. The hotel is located next to the beach, good for a stroll but not really a sunbathing/swimming beach; the lovely pool area caters for that. This year we visited the nearby Hare Krishna temple which is definitely worth a look."
2536,"Having stayed at amazing hotels throughout my holiday in India during December 2013, this is definitely a hotel not to visit. Service is bitterly pathetic with absolutely no accountably or customer service. Response to a complaint is even worse. Poor location and definitely not worth the money. Rooms were dusty and dirty. Breakfast was hazardous!"
2537,"J W Marriot is located in front of Juhu beach and one can see the sea from the window.  The restaurant Arola is mindblowing, perfect ambience and suitable for couples.  The bar is excellent. The room of the hotel is like any other 5 star, the loos are full glass and marble on all sides."
2538,This place is fantastic. Great views of the beach. Awesome grounds. Just great. Rooms are up to date -- modern and clean. The service is also very good. The only knock? The buffet is in a grand hall -- so feels a bit cafeteria-like...but this is forgotten after seeing the variety of food available. Highly recommend this property.
2539,"We stayed here for a full 12 days in January 2014 and loved every moment of it.  Every staff member we encountered was extremely pleasant and accommodating.  The location is second to none, right in front of the beach and close to all the high-end shopping spots.  The best part of the stay had to be the breakfast, an endless variety and supply of indulgent treats served each and every day.  We will definitely stay here each and every time we visit Mumbai.  Our special thanks goes to the GM Mr. Nambhiar."
2540,From the moment we were picked up at the airport our introduction and experience of the team at J W Marriott was set. The level of customer service was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble and the team in the club exec lounge were first class. Our short time here was magical and we loved every last minute right down to the last sunset and beer in hand. Can't wait for our next visit.
2541,"The hotel is in one the prime locations in Mumbai, Juhu. The beach is easily reachable by walk. The spa was great. The hotel has the best bed to sleep. The sleep just amazing. A must stay hotel for everyone travelling to Mumbai..."
2542,Its one of the best experience you can fetch in a busy city like Mumbai. specially their new Japanese restaurant. select west facing room as its best to have a sunset view right through your window. Its located in middle of the city so travel is quite easy and is 20-25 minutes from airport.  All the night clubs are close by with-in 3-4 kms reach.
2543,"My girlfriends and I went on a two week trip to India and our last stop was the JW Marriott in Mumbai.  We had an amazing stay and it was truly to all the wonderful staff we met on our two days in the hotel who made this stay an unforgettable experience.   It started with our Check in :  We did not like the first room, we had an inmediate solution provided by the Front Desk to change and the bellman waited for us and transferred us immediately to a different room with our luggage.   We really enjoyed the food in the Main Cafe and had a wonderful waiter named Nico, who provided us with endless refills of the amazing bread and that with a wonderful smile.   We were planning a birthday surprise for our friend for the next day and asked for assistance at the Concierge Desk to set up"
2544,Stayed for 3 nights. Spacious rooms and great cleanliness. Stayed in a sea view room. Hospitality was great and so was the delicious breakfast which should not be missed. Spa is also a must do here. Overall a true 5* experience.
2545,"Excellent place, well mannered staff. Excellent Service. The name is enough :) Staff is very cooperative,overall it waz a great stay and wud be stayn there again on my next visit to mumbai............"
2546,"This is our go to hotel when we are in Mumbai and stay here twice a year, the service just gets better with every visit. They have now had an upgrade since our last stay and the executive lounge amazing! With a breathtaking view of the sunset and juhu beach. The staff at the executive lounge and throughout jw are so friendly and helpful! They all go the extra mile to put a smile on your face. I wasn't feeling very well and the girls in the exec lounge looked after me, Rekha, Akanksha, Sana and Alok were so helpful. These guys felt like family, the chefs in the lounge are also amazing and cooked me some curd rice for my upset stomach. The food throughout the hotel is amazing!  The breakfast choice is fantastic the eggs Benedict were my favourite, with ranges from dosas to full"
2547,The room was spacious and clean with a great view of the ocean. There is very easy access to the beach from the hotel and we walked every morning on Juhu beach. The breakfast included an unbelievable spread and is not to be missed! It was a true 5* experience.
2548,"visited mumbai in dec 2013,stayed in jw marriot for 4 nights.it wz an amazing stay frm the beginning.great hospitality.got a sea view rm which wz great.the room service wz excellent.we were able to also attend the IRFW which coincidently at the hotel thn.so overall it waz a great stay  and wud be stayn there again on my next visit to mumbai........"
2549,"Excellent Service. The name is enough :)  Staff is very cooperative, located at good location. Provided complimentary additional meals and stay for me. Spa is must try here. It is near to airport. Have a nice stay and journey."
2550,We were planning to stay at the JW Marriott for 2 weeks in Dec 2013 but in the event it turned out to be almost a month because my father had a heart attack and was in hospital for some time during our stay. The hotel and staff were excellent and nothing was 'impossible'. They gave us a lot of support and help during a difficult time and became part of our family - this and top service in everything. Thank you and we will come again! Highly recommended at every level. Mr Abhvani and family.
2551,"I went for family holiday in this hotel and stayed for three days. I requested for Merc for picking up from airport but got another car, despite of twice confirmation from my booking manager.  Upon entering the hotel, they had a huge lobby, but room was too small, it offered me sea view but room was really uncomfortably small.   Breakfast was ok, but entrance gallery is amazing. Its not value for money I say, in same prices we can get Novotel in Juhu which has much better facilities. Though staff is supportive and caring."
2552,"I had stay 15th of Jan for my BS partner bday amazement I like to cheers GR staff for create ultimate experience for us with cake flower and card with warm greeting; they pleasure all time as Namaste which I adored. I picked by BMW with wi- fi facility. Chauffeur Sanjay was obliging and outgoing. when we reach on floor and  our suite was 335 we are not cognizant all facility in suite, I came out and find  HK TL Minakshi with leer face ,she came inside & assist me with all obligation she is very friendly and provide prompt service and feel  Wow I like her professional approach words which communicate with us . During stay we always order with Room service Neha OT was well trained professional  after that we went to Exc lounge we found small lady forgot her name she is too prompt"
2553,"I like this hotel a lot. We always visit for lunch or dinner when we are in Mumbai.   This time we stayed for 5 nights. The location is great if you want to be in north Mumbai (Juhu, Santa Cruz, etc.) and it does not take long from the airport‚Äîa blessing when you arrive in the middle of the night as a lot of flights are scheduled to do.   The food is good and we really enjoyed the view of the beach from our room.   However, we have had very poor experiences with the spa and beauty salon. I would never use these again and it put me off from the whole hotel. I wonder if they are under the same management as the rest of the hotel. The hotel makes such an effort to impress visitors at the entry but it totally falls apart in the that area.   We also felt that the pool area was not"
2554,"I stayed here for 2 lots of 5 days, The staff were very friendly and helpful, They remembered my drink order from the first time. The location is great, Just a few minutes walk to some local shops and right on the beach. The pool and outdoor area is extremely nice and peaceful. The beds are probably the comfiest I have slept in while travelling, The Buffet has everything you would want for breakfast. I liked the view from my room, I got a good view of Juhu Aerodrome and could watch the incoming flights for the Mumbai International Airport. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to go back someday."
2555,"We stayed for 5 days and it was absolutely luxurious - everything just flows smoothly! We used the Lounge each day and it was a great experience - the view of the enormous pool area and the beach is stunning, especially at sunset. The food was perfect but the best thing was the excellent service we received from the two waiters (they felt more like friends) Aalok and Naren. They were so good at making us feel comfortable with their constant smiling and joking - such great guys! Saif was really good at helping us with concierge service concerning our flights. The two guys in the fitness center were also really good at helping - a joy to stay at this hotel!"
2556,"Always a calm and quiet oasis in Mumbai.  The hidden treasure is their bar Arola - to the left and towards the rear of the hotel as you go in.  There is an excellent restaurant across the road called Melting Pot.  Went there twice in one week.  Great food, but that's another review."
2557,Everything you can want from a great hotel! amazing facilities and great food. In an ideal location to see the sounds and sights of Mumbai and a brilliant selection of breakfast treats and dinner options as well.
2558,"My past reviews of this property has always rated it in the very good to excellent category. I saw the Hotel while it was being built and have stayed there from its opening, through the 2008 Attacks and the past several years. The hotel was always managed it seemed by Europeans/Americans who you would notice walking around but never seemed to interact with guests. Recently, it promoted an Australian NRI who was GM at the Goa Marriott for a few years, to the GM at the JW.  Pavithran Nambiar is a breath of fresh air. Young and eager to take the JW to the next level, he personally met with me when I voiced some concerns about the ""organized chaos"" at the Main caf√© that serves buffets to guests. I am also an investor in Marriott and have  timeshares so it‚Äôs always worthwhile to see"
2559,"Visited a number of cities during the 2011 Cricket World Cup in India and we were fortunate to have a couple of spare days at the end of the trip in Mumbai. A friend suggested we stay at this hotel, despite the price, we thought why not.  This is a superb hotel.  Walked into a spacious reception area, check in was prompt and our room was  beautiful and luxurious  - and that was  standard!  The buffet restaurant downstairs served an incredible breakfast, a combination of Indian food and typical western continental or cooked breakfasts.  Service throughout was top class and will definitely go back for a longer stay"
2560,From food to rooms to the business center to the services are just awesome. the interiors of the hotel is very classic and overall experience is very positive. For business meetings it is perfect coz of its location.
2561,"The JW Marriott Mumbai is really wonderful. I particularly liked staying in Juhu, as some of the other hotels such as the Taj are located in more touristy areas, so are surrounded by more foot and car traffic. The rooms are wonderful, and the staff was very helpful. The breakfast is really great, that in itself made us look forward to the next day! We ate at Spices and the coffee shop- both were good. Nothing but good things to say about this place!"
2562,great hotel and amazing food. very good customer service. chefs were friendly. tailor made menu. Good cars. Nice pool. Airport transfer service was very good. There was a representative to help us check in at the airport counter. Good room service.
2563,JW Marriott was one of the best hotel I have stayed.I was given a room right in the middle where we could have a good view of the sea and the pool. The view was awesome. The staff were excellent. The service during the breakfast was excellent where there were staff going around to each table offering fresh bread and offering Mumbai special tea in a small glass with kettle. And also attending to every table to check whether we require anything else. I would strongly recommend this hotel.Keep up the good work.The only set back was the breakfast variety was the same everyday. But the wide variety of food covered that part.
2564,I have no other words to use but relaxation. This hotel stands out from the rest with its peace and serenity. The staff at this hotel were nothing short of amazing. Thank you for such an outstanding experience! I will definitely be returning soonest.
2565,"I wanted to write this sometimes earlier, but then got busy. We went for a Roadshow hosted at this hotel in Mumbai by the Eastern Europe tourism and all travel agents across Mumbai were invited. I must tell you this place has the most pathetic security guards for any kind of hotel. They scream at you and even talk behind your back when you enter giving remarks. When you wish to complain there is no one available to even listen to you and they just seem to very busy to even listen to anyone's complaints. If this is a 5* hotel and the so called brand they should teach thier staff how to behave with people first and foremost. Hope somebody takes any actions."
2566,"I have visited this hotel several times in the last couple of years and I must admit that its a lovely hotel. You truly get the 5 star feel when u walk in to the lobby and around the place. The JW brand aroma is something that takes you into a different world altogether. The swimming pool and the jacuzzi is something that you just cannot miss out on. Also do try Arola - the Spanish restro. Amazing place. Stayed here again last week, and was upgraded to the Premier rooms being an elite member. Was welcomed by a nice flower bouquet and a hand written 'welcome back' note by the guest relations manager Poonam Chauhan. Truly a wonderful gesture. Also the check in and check out was very smooth and flawless. Special thanks to Rhuddhesh Kirtikar for taking great care of us during our"
2567,"I would never forget this hotel. The best one in town. Neat n clean rooms, bathrooms, and the best maintainance facilities. Whenever I would would go to mumbai, this the only one where I would like to stay."
2568,"It is an excellent hotel, what is really nice about it is the excellent and almost limitless collection of food that is on offer, Stayed there on a business trip and really enjoyed the facilities that is offered, Great location too."
2569,I usually stay in this hotel for business purpose. Took my family for first time and stayed there for 3 nights. Outstanding services. Especially the in room dining department. My kids (from US) had different food requirements and timings - they catered to everything we needed. Poonam - the manager and Neha in in room dining were outstanding.
2570,Great location. Great Hotel.   Good People. Good Food.   Amazing Experience.   Located at Juhu - where the Indian Film industry stays surrounded by some other great hotels.   This place stands out and you usually see a lot of bollywoood crowd frequent this place.   Highly Recommended
2571,"We have gone to hotel on new year night, they made it memorable night. The location of the hotel is such that you will want to go there again and again. Its close proximity with the heart of the city makes it more appealing. The ambience itself has been a prime factor for me to stay there during my last visit. The customer service and experience is absolutely fantastic and so is the restaurant food."
2572,Very Superb Property High Class people of Bollywood comes here for Dinner here very often met many of them Spa is also superb and swiing pool too very high class will surely visit again when possible have lot of memories from these propery All d Best Keep it up JW Marriot Mumbai
2573,Recently back from mumbai and what can I say excellent hotel friendly staff clean and smart rooms. Great place if you have children the swimming pool will keep them busy. Food was super and relaxing atmosphere. Place to be for New Years
2574,"First of all, the location of the hotel is such that you will want to go there again and again. Its close proximity with the heart of the city makes it more appealing. The ambience itself has been a prime factor for me to stay there during my last visit. The customer service and experience is absolutely fantastic and so is the restaurant food."
2575,The JW Marriott is an amazing hotel with great rooms. Also has a really nice outdoor pool.  The one disappointing thing about this hotel was the business center. The staff there while helpful were not trained.
2576,"I stayed at the JW Marriot on business in mid December for 4 nights and was hugely impressed with my stay.  My room was incredibly spacious and furnished with some great touches, like a docking station for an iPod and a great mini-bar, as well as fresh complimentary fruit each day.  The staff are fantastic, engaging with customers as they pass.  Nothing is too much trouble here.  My only feedback is that check in and check out took a solid 15 minutes, other than that it was a near perfect stay.  I'll definitely be staying here again."
2577,"I have stayed at this property previously and thought it was really nice with a great location. They have gone through a renovation and the rooms are looking better. I have to say that the service is pathetic. A JW Marriot not being able to solve the problem of an irrate customer is really the pits. At the end of the day, a hotel with good infrastructure but pathetic service is of no use to a traveler. Why I say what I say:  a. By the clock it took them half an hour to get a luggage trolley to the room.   b. The air-conditioner was making a noise through the night, I slept through it and on my way out registered a complaint with the front desk myself, which they logged into the system. What use is a complaint, when nothing is done about it. I come back to the hotel at 11pm (12"
2578,It is the best 3rd hotel I have seen  in Mumbai. It has best parking place. Room are very best & service is also best. A very good view of sea from your room. Check in was speedy and efficient. The hotel is located at the top of Juhu beach. There  was approx 1900 Rupees for the day but it is valueable for it.
2579,I stayed at JW Marriot for 2 nights from 13th December 2013. My room no. was 472. Hotel is at a very convinient location. It has very big sized room. Bathrooms are also large with optional partion with the room. Swimming Pool is almost right on the sea beach & you can have a very good view of sea from your room if you are lucky to have room on that side & I was one of them.
2580,"I stayed at the JW Marriott for 4 nights from the 21st December 2013.  If I remember correctly our room number was 282.    The room was a great size, clean and spacious.  I loved the glass bathroom dividers.  Vijay who cleaned floor 2 was excellent.   The lounge at the Marriott has to be without a doubt one of the best Marriott lounges we have stayed at. Aksanka? at the lounge desk was always smiling and was a great hostess. The lounge offered a great choice of wine, spirits , cocktails and good food. It was a great place to unwind at the end of the a long day in Mumbai.  BREAKFAST- Now this is one area the hotel could improve on. The food itself was great.  However the organisation could be improved.  TAXIS- The hotel is located at the top of JUHU beach.  We didn't have a"
2581,"I stayed here with Mme. Bolleaux and we had an excellent stay. As a previous reviewer stated, it is in an affluent part of Mumbai, but in India, that doesn't mean much. The hotel property is great, we enjoyed a suite and it was first rate. Check in was speedy and efficient, although there was a minor fracas at one of the check in desks, a reservation had gone missing! The staff could not have been more professional, I would like to give a special mention to Poonam Chauhan, Guest Relations Manager. The hotel is on the beach and you will see lots of people walking up and down the beach at all hours, but surprisingly, no one in the water swimming. We decided to go down to the beach, there is access from the pool gardens. A full time security guard mans the large steel gate to the"
2582,"The Marriot has a great location. Its in the midst of an affluent part of the town. Hence, you have lot of pubs, bars and restaurants arrount the hotel. The hotel is quite comfortable. The rooms are quite spacious and the staff are quite nice. The hotel also has the Enigma night club, which is quite popular with locals."
2583,Very very good hotel with 6* service - nice pool and beautiful sea view - exec lounge outstanding in terms of choice and service. A bit far if u want to visit south mumbai but near airport and good for business.  First time i got a nice very clean room with plenty of bottled water :-) second time i got a suite on first floor that has a living room as big as home :-) Top hotel - must try in mumbai!
2584,We normally use the Marriott Courtyard in Mumbai but due to very busy period it was fully booked and we were offered the JW instead. A very large complex with 5 star facilities and on a beach side location it should have been a wonderful upgrade but as we had little time to enjoy the facilities it fell somewhat flat. Starting with a mix up over a duplicate reservation the check in took some time and then we had to find our own way to our rooms and take our own luggage which was a bit of a contrast to both the JW in Pune and even the Mumbai Courtyard which although a lower star rating seems to have service which is more friendly and slicker than this. That said the guest relations team did send flowers as a welcome gift but the rooms though well equipped and with good views were
2585,"I highly recommend this hotel. One of the best hotels I have stayed so far, in terms of quality, cost, comfort, service and you get all bang for your money. The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. Location superb"
2586,We stayed there for one night. Located in the most popular area of Mumbai. Many bollywood stars stay near that property. The most famous Juhu beach is at 10 minutes walk from the property. Shopping is comparatively expensive in that area. But people can enjoy local food on Juhu beach. It's tasty but may be unhygienic.
2587,"Though Mumbai beaches are not very good, but a hotel close to the beach is still an attraction for someone used to living inland. Even without counting the  proximity to the beach, the Hotel gives a  very spacious feel. The lawns are well maintained as you would expect from a hotel of this category. The buffet restaurant is huge and the food great."
2588,"it is so plesent to stay in the beach front and the view is wounder full ...it is so lovely food to taste from diffrent resturant in side the hotel . i lov the hotel because of the area and the look.. it is soo nice to stay every time with family, staff r well good taking care ."
2589,"The JW Marriott is really wonderful place to entertain business guest. Excellent service , food gives all type of satisfaction to Guest and helps to materialize the business deal in right direction. Very good experience & would suggest others to at least visit once and get the feeling."
2590,The JW is quite a grand hotel.  Wonderful food and lots of it.  The staff is particular friendly and very responsive. It certainly meets the test for a quality hotel.  The rooms are sort of small but well appointed.  Take the access door by the pool to the beach.  It is great for a morning and afternoon walk.  Walking on the street side is noisy and hard to navigate.
2591,"Was  at the J W for a Business Event at the JW Marriott in March. Great hospitality and service by the staff. They made sure our 3 day event was very successful. The banquets we utilized were clean and well equipped. Our meals there were delicious. The staff bent backwards and made sure everything functioned smoothly for us. We are so delighted with the experience we have that we come back to the Marriott year after year. Hopefully all going well, we will be back at the Marriott for our event early next year.  Extremely satisfied !!!!"
2592,"Hotel is a really luxury excellent in site and design, best part of is overlooking the sea you can swim in swimming pool and also can enjoy the scenic view of Arabian sea, Dining area of Hotel is very big in size and rooms are awesome rooms are very well organized with latest gadget and very close to all major tourist attraction and market as well as business center although rates of spa is little bit in higher side, but one can stay in hotel for a good leisure time , dining in hotel is really very good and all staffs are very freindly in nature"
2593,"JW Marriott definitely holds up to the expectations of the staying at Marriott.  I can rate extreme satisfaction across the board in customer services, food, helpful and friendly team.    Had a pleasant and relaxing stay."
2594,"J.W Marriott Hotel, Mumbai has been completely redesigned to be the ultimate destination for contemporary style and luxury in the city. Overlooking the ocean, the hotel welcomes you with space and serenity. Luxuriously appointed guestrooms have been meticulously planned with a host of innovative features using the latest technology.  J.W Marriott Hotel, Mumbai is located on Juhu Tara Road, the famed boulevard along the coast. An hour's drive from the airport and only minutes away from the business, financial and entertainment districts, the hotel is also well located to visit the city‚Äôs tourist attractions.  The hotel offers a rich variety of dining experiences ranging from an all day dining restaurant serving global cuisine, to an Italian Restaurant and a signature Indian"
2595,"The JW lives up to the Marriott name with good service, nice accommodations, and great dining.  Location is ok - can't really wander around outside.  Still, felt secure within.  Would recommend for business travel."
2596,"I am a frequent stayer of Marriott and often am disappointed by either the hours or services provided by the concierge level lounge. However the food, service, and hours of the JW Marriott on Mumbai is outstanding!   We will definitely be back for another visit."
2597,"I spent a week at this hotel in December and I can not fault the accommodation, food or service. Nothing was too much trouble and I was made to feel welcome and valued. All staff spoke good English and all smiled when ever you approached them. Excellent hotel and very good staff."
2598,"Tiny tiny rooms which make your stay uncomfortable, very average food quality from breakfast to all their restaurants besides the cute coffee shop by the lobby. Far better hotels in Mumbai for the same price or lower!"
2599,"I stayed at the JW in June and became ill. The hotel staff were marvellous in the way they handled this. They called a doctor for me, sent for the prescription, but went much beyond the call of duty to check that I was OK. They phoned my room regularly to check I was well and sent me a nice bunch of flowers. The nicest touch was that they offered to prepare me some simple food which the chef himself delivered."
2600,"Pretty good hotel  Spacious  Excellently appointed room  Wonderful service  Thought the pool area was grubby to be honest  Good restaurants generally. Ironically found Saffron, their Indian restaurant, to be the weakest, the Spice Thai and Mezzo Mezzo Italian were better  Availed myself of the Executive lounge which was great. I was sold it on check in as a one off fee for 3500 INR which covered drinks and food etc. This was great.  What was not so great was when I checked out they then told me it was 3500 rupees per day which didn't represent value to me I insisted I only paid the original amount.  They caught another colleague out like this - be warned  For this reason I rated the hotel as average only"
2601,"The Marriott in Mumbai is like many other Marriott's: huge! this one is different in the fact that on the lower lobby floor it has an incredible buffet of great local food..so Curry 3 times a day isn't always necessary...But curry is available in the morning should you desire! Good sized rooms with good facilities, clean & fresh laundry, well sound proofed too, so the nearby elevators & family party down the hall didn't disturb my stay one bit. The Hotel for me is located a bit far North in Mumbai..I like the more southern tip..but it's a good central location to see as much as possible..30/45 from the airport & Chor Bazaar."
2602,"Let's start with the Good.  THE GOOD: The bed was super comfortable, and the Executive Lounge was great.  It appears the rooms have been renovated.  Our rooms (yes, rooms) had sea views.  Front desk staff was generally nice.  Spices Restaurant was great.  The bakery near the lobby is nice.  Now, to the Bad and Ugly... THE BAD: The hotel is showing signs of age, particularly the pool area.  The hotel management needs to mitigate the numerous birds that congregate around the pool area, as it is not appealing to see birds bathing in the pool.  We did not like the Lotus Cafe because it is too big and loud, and service was not that good.  Due to issues (mentioned below), we had to repeat our concerns and inform the front desk staff of concessions that we were provided so that we"
2603,The Right Place to Stay @ Mumbai.If you are at Mumbai Please stay @ JW MARRIOT.We stayed at Room no 344 it has Very good sea facing Room with good facilities.Especially their service was very good With Food & Bevarages.We also want to mark Some Star Workers.  1. Grishma Hostess @ Executive Lounge.  2. Riane Front  Office Manager.  3. Akansha Hostess @ Executive Lounge.  These above staffs are Star Rated in the Hotel.
2604,"Enjoyed staying at J W M in Juhu Mumbai. Lounges, very good, although the coffee shop - bakery could be more efficient in taking orders. Breakfast amazing with every cuisine conceivable, fresh juices and hot stations. Waiter staff very attentive but a bit frustrating when wanting u to fill a feedback form everyday (with their aim to please policy. Nice touch live sitar music played in morning. Deluxe rooms very nice, modern though on the small side. Bathroom sections off/partitions, giving a fuller or less space a/c to privacy. Sea view was good. The spa and outdoor pools very good too. All the facilities good. I would stay here again. Bollywood stars can be spotted here too!"
2605,"Having patronised Marriott hotels for many years, one expects a certain level of hospitality that this brand is known for across the world. The JW Marriott in Mumbai tends to be inconsistent in the level of service and food quality. But what strikes me about the Mumbai location is their willingness to immediately take corrective action in response to feedback given. Staff generally are friendly and courteous- however one hopes that we don't always have to call the Executive chef about the food or the Guest Relations rep about other services- perhaps the training of staff needs to be more frequent and focused."
2606,"My first stay at JWM in Mumbai. I had stayed at almost all Luxury Five star (Genuine Luxury ) hotels in Mumbai. I went through Tripadvisor Ratings before booking. I had high expectations as this being JWM. But as I checked in, things were different (you have to pay for everything here and forget any freebies). The Deluxe Rooms are so small and cramped that you feel as you have been packed in a box without Air. They provide Square shape pillows to sleep. It is very depressing to stay in such a room. I ordered for in-room dining. The staff was not aware of the contents and food was not upto mark. I had stayed in other JWM properties and I didn't find stay in this hotel as expected from JWM."
2607,"Let me start by saying that this hotel is thoroughly decent hotel, just not sure it's worth the money.  I had spent three nights in Mumbai hit the beach for the week then returned to a Mumbai. We had an early flight so picked a hotel close to the airport(which it is) and on Juhu as we'd not seen Juhu on our earlier trip. It is right on Juhu.  The hotel entrance is very grand, staff very friendly and the location is good.  I thought it was a decent hotel. 5 star luxury, not so sure.  The pool area was not the cleanest, lots of bird muck in and around the pool, on the loungers and walkways. Some looked like it had been there a while.   The rooms were quite small but did have a sea view. Was was odd, stayed in many a Marriott and never seen this before, all class bathrooms with the"
2608,"I stayed here on a business trip and the service was impeccable.  As a non-native the staff was always at the ready to help with whatever your request was.  From laundry service to having cars and drivers available for getting around, the hotel staff were accommodating and helpful.  The hotel interior is beautiful and the room was spacious.  The view was unfortunately hindered by the smog, but this was not the hotel's fault.  The facilities at the hotel are well run and clean.  The various restaurants and bars located within the hotel provided choices and variability.  The general feel was more resort like rather than hotel like."
2609,"Ate in the restaurant, super surroundings, live music and brilliant service. Don't get  the razor clams, they were tough as old shoe leather! The complimentary ice cream after dinner was superb, particularly the chocolate and strawberry!"
2610,This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in India . The service as fantastic and the breakfast buffet has everything you could wish for. The pool is very nice too and a great place to relax. My wife and I ate in all the restaurants there and the food was excellent in particular the Italian with chef davide coming out personally and greeting the diners. Once you step through the security gate and enter the crowded beach area you get hit with a bit of a smell and the water is not very inviting but this is no fault of the hotel. I would recommend stopping here last on any trip to India as you will be spoilt and the others will probably not match the standard set here
2611,Excellent and well located and staff is really helpful and good. Rooms are nice but a bit small. Lobby and pool are excellent. Breakfast is really excellent. The check in was good and most hotel staff were cheerful and happy and always asking if they can be of any help (spl mention of Akanksha - guest relations at the executive lounge). The food quality is also excellent. Definitely worth a stay here!
2612,"We stayed at the JW Marriott Mumbai for a very short (12 hours) time while in transit from a cruise to our flight home.  From the time we reached the hotel until we were dropped off at the airport (using the hotel's car service)  we were treated with warmth and grace.  From initial check in, the clean and well maintained room, excellent wifi connectivity, to the concierge lounge and finally transportation to the airport, all was provided efficiently and with smiles.  The staff of the JW could not have been more accommodating and helpful.  We will definitely stay at this JW again."
2613,Very nice experience to stay at this hotel  Room are great and so is the pool area Staff is very courteous and helpful Wide choice of food in breakfast and dinner Overall a fantastic experience. If you love authentic Italian food then the Mezzo Mezzo restaurant at the hotel offers choicest of Italian cuisine under the expert leadership of chef Davide.
2614,Had booked this property to chill out and take some rest in October 2013 had booked a ocean view suitethe room was very good service was excellent but didn't really enjoy the ambiance cause the. Hotel is usually crowded Infact over crowded specially in the evenings but as it is near the juhu beach a central location in the suburb it's worth if you can enjoy with people around to rate it a very good property doing really well but if you wanna have a quiet and peacefully time it's not for you unless you just wanna be I the room .
2615,"whenever i visit JW i dont miss my home, It is like my second house. The very nice thing is it is connected to airport.The SPA is also good and the service also. yes also i cant miss the beach view.fell like king..."
2616,"First time I went for a coffee and after experiencing the beautiful setting of the Hotel, we never miss staying or visiting on any trip to Mumbai. wonderful service, excellent setting that makes one feel Royal."
2617,JW Marriott Mumbai is one of the most beautiful Marriott properties I have come across. The grandeur of the lobby is simply mesmerizing! What i really love about is the impeccable service at the restaurants as well as in the room. It was a memorable experience!
2618,"After nice Honey Moon trip to Kerla,we come to this Hotel,all Great,from check in to house keeping staff,every time coming with fruit basket,one day Chief cooker come to visit all guest on breakfast time,I say today is anniversary of my wife and he send at evening big bucket of flower and cake good ornamentation...Nice to stay again,Palace at Galance."
2619,"JW marriot is not a hotel, its a home away from home. I have travelled extensively and stayed at some of the most exquisite properties. While all have their 'hotelish' feel, JW Marriot Mumbai gives you the experience of actually feeling 'at home' and not in a hotel.  On one of my recent stays I was literally shocked that every staff from the vallet boy to the room service boys, all new my name. very impressive indeed. That apart I also tried the food at Mezzo Mezzo, and the Coffee Shop on the ground floor (forget the name), but the spread and the taste of food at both the places was outstanding."
2620,"I stayed for a short break and was impressed with the property, the staff and the spa. The poolside is for hotel guests and spa members only and was lovely. Overlooking the Arabian Sea it's a fabulous setting. The spa is spacious and the staff are well trained in the treatments. The selection if treatments is very good.  The Arola bar is a great place to be in the evening. It's quiet and secluded and very romantic."
2621,"After so long traveling, it his hotel was just what I needed.  So comfortable, fabulous amenities. The breakfast buffet was delicious. So many food items to choose from. Beautiful music came from local musicians.  The staff was the friendliest I've ever experienced. I recommend this hotel for long or short stays.  Thank you!"
2622,Wonderful experience. Super luxury .. The front office team is very helpful and welcoming. Restaurant staff always check on the experience . It was nice to see chefs interacting with guests. Definitely a hotel with high standards
2623,"A top class hotel with a back side access to the Juhu beach, close to the airport(The hotel offers free pick up & drop).   The staff was friendly and the ambiance of the hotel & rooms, excellent. The breakfast was excellent with a huge spread.   Stayed for 2 nights on business....a great experience overall!!"
2624,The hotel is located well facing the beach. Also close to the airport. The BBC Cafe is good but food at Lotus is not worth the money. Try the Pizzas at Mezzo Mezzo its pretty good. The pool side is awesome and relaxing and peaceful. The service is not very impressive though.
2625,"Have stayed at a number of Marriott properties across countries and overall quality and service consistency is always mantianed. Had a residential conference at JW Marriott, Juhu. The staff was very helpful and courteous, they accomodated 1-2 of ours last minute requests. The breakfast menu offers great variety, of the options in resturants will surely recommend Saffrron. If its suits in budget, one can surely expect great service and above par quality for a business traveller at JW Marriott"
2626,"I cannot give justice in my review to this great hotel in Juhu beach, Mumbai, but I will try. The Marriott is all about accommodating all their customer's tailored requirements and needs. From the moment I landed in Mumbai to when I left I felt like I was well looked after. The hotel had arranged a complimentary pick up for me at the airport and the driver was polite and courteous, and provided me with cooling refreshments as well as WiFi in the car on the way to the hotel (something which has become some what of a necessity to me). On arrival to the hotel I was warmly welcomed and checked with ease, we had the executive suite which was a large room with an extended living area overseeing the Juhu Beach. The service was great and had service staff roaming our floor round the"
2627,"I select it due to being close to business district. However, it is not recommended if you are looking for attracting near downtown. I enjoyed the stay specially the view, lobby and delicious restaurant Saffron."
2628,"A great place for a business traveler like me. Cosy room with modern amenities. Good value for money. Located at very good location near the business hub of the city. Stayed only for a night decent breakfast and take care of you during the stay, thank you. Would love to visit again. Highly recommended for business traveler."
2629,"Getting to stay in this king of properties sometime has its own advantages. Marriott group of hotels have always been a preferred choice. Almost everything about it is amazing. Right from the Rooms, Location, Ambiance and food. Easy reach to Airports, shopping and movies."
2630,The hotel has a great view of the Juhu beach and the Arabian sea beyond that. The hotel is well spread out and beautifully landscaped. The buffet spread is also fantastic. It used to have quite a knocking nightclub too. The rooms were a bit cramped though compared to the overall feel of the place. The swimming pool/sea facing rooms felt a lot better though.
2631,"We had booked a standard room at the hotel, the hotel is very good with a great view and five star facilities. The room size was bit small than most standard rooms but view was good. It is a fairly large a busy hotel so service wasnt as great. The restaurants were excellent. The pool and Spa faclities are top of the line and best in the city."
2632,"Excellent hotel.Best hotel in Mumbai near the airport on juhu beach.excellent staff  I found the staff  went extra mile and got the best service .Resturants , rooms  excellent.I would rate the hotel 10/10.Been to lots of 5/6* hotels this is the best hotel I rate ."
2633,"I have been travelling to Mumbai for a number of years and have stayed at most of the 5 star hotels, but none of them compare to the JW.  Excellent Food , service and rooms.  You wont be disappointed.  always stays in the sea facing room, worth the extra"
2634,"This is a wonderful hotel, so why the 4/5 you ask? Well there are couple of things that I found annoying so on that basis I cannot give it maximum points! Anyway the good things, room beautiful, especially the bathroom! Staff 100% cannot fault any of them friendly efficient could not do enough, always smiling and doing that hands together mini bow thing they do here. Hotel facilities, excellent, clean spacious, magnificent decor. Food? well I tended to use the executive lounge mostly for breakfast and High tea, all very nice, I have no reason to believe the main restuarant is anything other than excellent too but here is where we start to get onto the reasons why this is not the 5/5 you'd expect for a 5 star hotel. I just found the whole thing too impersonal, for example the"
2635,"Came for business, chose this hotel as one of they were hosting one of the events I was going to. Things went wrong from pretty much straight away- my colleague and I were stranded at the airport for over an hour after booking a hotel car to pick us up. On another evening had problems with my room phone and had a technician in my room for nearly an hour while I was trying to work- despite telling him to leave. I was upgraded which was great- but then found I had my iphone cable missing from my room when I came back after a day out working. Then I was over charged at check out, which they did fix- but it was another mess up. So I thought that was the end of the errors  but then for my hotel car that I booked to take me to the airport, the driver decided to give another staff"
2636,"Although it is big name and excellent location. But my experience at this hotel was not very good. I fell ill here and was not looked properly by the staff. While I was dying in high fever, it constantly banged my door to check if I need a doctor ( they should have arranged without asking) and then they asked me will I pay in cash to the doctor ?? how stupid, they should have put in my room bill instead of troubling me again and again when I try to take rest while in fever. Then doctor asked to get medicines, they had not clue what to do and waiting for my instructions. I have never seen a hotel so inhuman like this !! I will never go there again !!"
2637,services are pathatic specially room services. I checked in and asked for smoking room but front desk inspite of the request gave me room on 2nd floor which is completely non smoking. Inpsite of repeated assurance to change the room nothing happened. Apart from that even the basic facilities such as wash basin was not working. Room was pathetically dingy. It was so bad that i left hotel by midnight itself.
2638,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Sight View, Excellent Service,Excellent Food & Nice Spa.Almost all five days experience the same courteous service, can easily suggest to stay in this hotel when visit to mumbai."
2639,"Enjoyed a long visit here recently and cannot praise the staff and service highly enough. The room was beautiful and always impeccably serviced. We had access to the executive lounge which I highly recommend, a good place to relax and chill with friendly people at the end of the day. Would definitely stay again. Only one small issue, keep the resident astrologer out of the executive lounge, if guests want to consult him, I am sure they will arrange that themselves. Great views of the sunset over Juhu beach from the lounge, peaceful and serene."
2640,"So this was my first time to the JW in Mumbai but I have yo say that I was not impressed at all.   Problems with my shower several times finally led me to moving to another room.  Avoid the beach. Lots of broken glass and trash everywhere. Would be nice if the hotel would clean up their area.  Might have to try another Marriott property next time.  Platinum Member,"
2641,"stayed for one night and I enjoyed the comfort of the hotel. staff were exceptional from reception to the restaurants. rooms small but very well taken care of and nice bathroom. we eat at the spanish restaurant which I would highly recommend. it also has a list of more that 30 different gin labels. we also had access to the executive lounge, a nice relaxing space where you can have champagne and snacks for free. overall a very pleasant experience"
2642,We have stayed in JW Marriott Hotel Mumbai  for 3 days and it was an amazing experience. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. We were there with my friends for Holidays. We have enjoyed the food a lot. The spa was awesome experience specially in India.
2643,"Excellent hotel in suburbs.  Lots of greenery, lights look beautiful at night.   sea view, beach access, outdoor swimming pools.  Spa services, coffee station, business centers, disco rooms.  morning buffet breakfast and lunch buffet superb."
2644,"My parents stayed in JW last weekend and they don't have words to express! the service, food, ambience was beyond excellent! Vaibhav Negandhi was the reservation staff that they interacted with and he was extremely courteous and knowledgeable.  Thank you mariott!"
2645,"Perfect hotel in Mumbai, great oasis to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai Unlike many hotels in Mumbai, lots of close by restaurants that are in walking distance The restaurants in the hotel are great as well, if possible ask for a room facing beach"
2646,"Spent 5 nights here. Comfortable, good ambience, only sticky point was the daily buffet dinner at the coffee shop which wasn't organized very well. The hotel also needs to put up a larger sign on the main road outside, as it's difficult to see. Facilities are great."
2647,"I had stayed at the JW Marriott before and used to love the hotel for everything so grand but it all changed today , was staying for one night on the 16 September, all went well till I woke up the next  morning for my meeting and dashed into the bathroom just to notice that there was no water in the shower I was fiddling with it for 10 minutes if I was doing anything wrong but finally gave up, called the maintenance guy who came after 10 minutes , and he came and told me that they had some electricity breakdown in which pressure pump was not working but said that he had fixed it up  and I could finally take a shower, took a shower finally and checked out . I asked for the duty manager while checking out and briefed him about this fiasco and rushed for the meeting haven't heard"
2648,"A beautiful hotel in an excellent location. It's placed right on the beach so you can access Juhu Beach from the swimming pool. Very clean rooms, fabulous hotel staff and restaurant team who would go out if their way to make you feel at home."
2649,"I've written a review for this hotel before, and given it exactly the same rating. Now, having stayed there on 5 separate occasions, I thought it was time to come back and do an update. This is not least because readers should know that special things happen on your 5th visit to the JWM in Mumbai (special rewards for loyalty, like massages and other treats). This is one of the most consistent hotels I have stayed in over the past few years, brilliantly located and equally good for both business and leisure. The rooms (those that have been renovated most recently) are ample, comfortable and luxurious. Special mention for universal adapters at all plug points - this is a very handy thing that all hotels should start doing! Breakfast is sumptuous, and for business clients airport"
2650,I have not seen any other hotel in Mumbai with such a great ambience. Excellant food with lot of varieties. The pool side rooms are so good you dont feel like coming out. This is athe best place for business meetings if you want near airport. Many film star are seen very frequently. Problably this is best hotel known for its food and service and of course great ambience.
2651,Celebrating my brother's birthday in a nice luxurious room with a view with the most relaxing atmosphere after a nice Summer vacation. Great Customer Service. Always neatly kept spotless. I have no complaints. Spacious and worth the price. Towels are fresh came here to  enjoy the pool. Friendly  very comfortable. I would definitely reccomend this hotel to my friends.
2652,"My second stay here and what can i say? This is the best place in mumbai to come in after a long flight from US and to unwind. The service is always excellent. This is a very happening place and always something exciting going on. Breakfast at lotus was not the best (it was good, dont get me wrong) and there are excellent dinner options nearby if you dont want to dine in.  The renovated executive lounge is fantastic and has a great view. The rooms are flawless and the lobby is one of the best. If you want to relax in mumbai and get pampered this is the place to visit."
2653,"Well what can i say. cant seem  to find a flaw here. You have to actually be here to experience the grandness and finesse of this Marriott property. The who's who of India and around the world chose this property for their stay and fine dining experience. The food in all the restaurants is bursting with taste. And yes, the pool overlooking the beach reminds one of Goa. This place has it all, this place is it!!!"
2654,Hotel is good but some services not in order.very expensive ...but fine dinning at saffron was a real experience.long time renovations taking place so the fun is missing.also club lounge shifted n food served is here is not upto Marriott standards.situated near airport n zuhu beach so I luv the surroundings n easy approach.
2655,"One of the best 5 star hotels in the world, excellent hospitality and customer care. I have travelled all over the world but till date I would grade JW marriot mumbai no.1 and would definitely stay over again."
2656,JW Marriott Hotel is minutes away from Juhu Beach and close to Shoppers Stop. This 5-star hotel is within close proximity of Versova Beach and Infinity Mall. wired and wireless Internet access is available for a surcharge. Very Good service.
2657,"This is one of the best hotel in India, very prime location, juhu beach is just walking distance from this hotel, hotel food, coffee shop and ambience of the hotel is amazing. This is the first choice of my wife as well as my kids. Hotel staff, reception staff is well behaved and well mannered. Sea view rooms are amazing, you feel like you are staying in the water. You feel like home in JW Marriot."
2658,"I stayed at this hotel in January 2013. This is ideal for business travellers and also families wishing to see Mumbai. It is situated in Juhu, where a lot of the film stars live. There was a press conference for a new Hindi film when we were staying there. The rooms are very spacious and the food in the hotel in fantastic. Staff all very helpful and ready to give tips about what is going on in Mumbai."
2659,My and my family have always stayed at the JW every time we have visited Mumbai.  The service and the breakfast is out of this world.  Of all the places I have travelled and of all the hotels I have stayed at JW service and the breakfast beats them all.  The hotel is so centerally located to all shopping outlets.  The price is a bit high but if you are coming in from Europe/Americas what you pay for is nothing compared to the luxuries you get a this hotel.  My fav hotel by far.
2660,"Our first choice whenever we visit Mumbai is the JW Marriott. A wonderful modern hotel situated in the Juhu part of this vibrant city, the location allows one to get to the interesting shopping parts of Mumbai easily as well as end the day in a relaxing comfortable location.  The service is stellar, which one would expect anyway in this part of the world; Indian hospitality is on another level and the warmth and homely feeling despite the size of the hotel is instantly felt. A great touch which the hotel often seems to get right is when guests arrive and are driven up the driveway in the hotel pick up car, the doorman greets you by name when he opens your door. This has happened with my family several times and I always feel that it is a truly personal touch when arriving at a"
2661,"JW Marriott in Juhu, Mumbai is an incredible hotel. We had two rooms booked sea facing and it was out of this world. Right from check in to going to the room, the hotel staff was excellent. The room we had connecting one suite and one room with two twin beds. Alll in al we had three bathrooms. The room are great and equipped with all the amenities needed. I was very impressed. The beds were very cozy and the rooms were sound proof as we heard no outside noise. The breakfast buffet was very lavish and I loved it, the staff at the buffet to name a few were great, Vinod, Nico and Ekta. My family was always very relaxed at the buffet and they ejoyed it immensely. The lotus resturant was very spacious and did not feel cramped at all. The reception area was grand and very inviting as"
2662,"Let me start this review with the clarity of the following: 1- I inadvertently booked the wrong rate online at the time of booking. 2- I fully understand this was MY error and own it wholeheartedly.  The issues started upon my checking in of 2 rooms at a discounted rate. We were greeted warmly and checked in accordingly. I do not speak Hindi and could tell there was some issue as the young lady called over 2 people to assist her during the process.   No one said anything to us so we simply waited patiently and was escorted into our rooms after a short while. Upon reaching the room, we were asked for our credit card and the number was manually written down on a piece of paper. I was concerned about privacy issues with having the number retained after the transaction was over. I"
2663,"I travelled to Mumbai for 5 nights on business and my stay at the Marriott was very good from beginning to end. I dined in the Italian (very good) and Spices (didn't enjoy so much) and the service was excellent in both. The spa was amazing and I had a really good massage with a lovely masseuse. Very relaxing environment - would definitely recommend.  The gym was excellent, something I don't see regularly in the hotels I've stayed in before. The equipment was modern and in good condition - I enjoyed a couple of sessions.  Rooms were lovely, very spacious and clean. The shower was lovely. Mini bar was let well stocked and the really had thought of everything. All in all a great hotel - would recommend to stay."
2664,"Having stayed recently at the JW in Pune and rated it as probably the best i have ever experienced I was advised to give this hotel a try, I was not disappointed, whoever trains the staff at JWs deserves a massive credit, the staff here were exceptional.  I had 2 VERY minor issues, one was my second glass of (real) fresh orange did not arrive, so I noted it on my assessment with the bill. Within 30 mins I was contacted personally to apologise and explain - unbelievable! The food in the Italian restaurant was fantastic, how wonderful to get a proper portion of lamb,so often a couple of tiny chops! And perfectly cooked as well. The 'street food' in the restaurant was a truly brilliant idea, everyone raves about Indian street food, but I was naturally reluctant to 'go for it' at"
2665,"Stayed at the JW Marriott for one night while transiting between the International and domestic aiports, in the middle of a long trip with quite a number of 5 star hotels from different chains.  Compared to the others in the areas of service and room quality, the JW Marriott was somewhat below average.  The check-in process was ridiculous-- it took nearly 30 minutes, for no apparent reason.  The room was quite small for the price.  That said, the breakfast and restaurant experience was really outstanding.  This was easily the best breakfast spread I've had anywhere (and I've seen many!) - both in terms of the variety and the quality of the food offerings, to say nothing of the beautiful view.  The restaurant staff was also very attentive; the Food and Beverage manager himself"
2666,I stayed here for 2 days to attend a seminar organised by our company. The room was overlooking the beach. Nice and spacious. They really treat you royally. Right from airport to hotel reception. I especially liked the welcome ceremony done in traditional way. Food was excellent. One of  the best 5 star hotels in India.
2667,"I was staying at this property between 02/08/2013 & 04/08/2013. If I was to sum it all up in one word, I would say brilliant!! We had two different rooms booked here, one being the Premiere Club Executive Room & the other being a Deluxe Room.  I would only recommend booking the Premiere Club Room, as it is adequately spacious and the Ocean View Room provide the best views overlooking the sea. During our stay we did manage to acquaint ourselves with many celebrities.  The advantage of staying at this property is the location.  It is in the center of most of the tourist spots around Mumbai.  Coming to the service, well it is definitely commendable, the personal attention that one receives at this property is phenomenal.  One actually feels like a personal guest here.  We did for"
2668,"I was at the JW Marriott Mumbai in October of 2010 for business and could not have had a better time. The Hotel was immaculate and the Restaurant was just the best. Other than my own room door, I don't think I opened a door my entire week there. They treat you like a king. Mumbai is very stark so Americans will be surprised that you have a very nice hotel next to poverty, but that is part of the experience of staying here."
2669,"Stayed recently at the hotel by accident. We were booked at Four Seasons Worli but due to the distance involved in going into town we decided to stay at the Marriott.  I m glad we decided to stay here. The hotel is conveniently located to the airport and all the major residential suburbs of Bandra, Andheri and Santa Cruz. In Mumbai that is definately a plus. The rooms are neat and functional. Staff are courteous and know their job. We had drinks with friends at the Aurela..... It has a lovely table in the open with a direct view of the beach..... Food is great and the ambience a delight. Definitely to be recommended. Would like to return to this property in the future."
2670,"I went there on my wedding anniversary with my family and booked 3 rooms.This hotel seriously needs renovation from outside. We had gone for a family outing but there was hardly anything for family and children.The beach outside was very dirty. It is a business hotel. If you are living in Mumbai then Resort at Madh is better opption for a weekend.The Lotus restaurant, Mezo Mezo and BBC are good,staff is couretous and specially Ami Panchal EA to GM."
2671,"We are regulars at JW Marriott Mumbai and every time it has been a pleasing experience. We stayed at JW Mumbai from the 7th till 11th. The staff are extremely helpful and the food at the Lotus restaurant is outstanding . Special mention to the Chef de Cuisine Stanley Lopes and the Restaurant Manager Giles . Great guys, looked after us really well. The Concierge is very helpful and so is the House keeping . We had a few issues with the house keeping but the supervisor sorted it out really quickly.  Mr & Mrs. S.Lahiri"
2672,"I stayed twice here. once in july n second time inaugust. first time (I can give room number also - 464) the AC stoppeed working at 2am. I had to call in service guys n they fixed. no worries in that, but guys, y should I get up at 2 when I'm staying in executive room.... second time I stayed before a day. the bathroom pipeline or gutter line was probably blocked. after 10min I saw everything was flooded. this is not done guys. didnt expect this.  still I would say, except these two probs, every damn thing was perfect in marriot. but mood was spoiled cuz of these probs"
2673,"Perhaps one of the best customer experiences I've had during a stay at a hotel. The staff, lounge, and food at the hotel is superb. The restaurant Aurela is truly a great experience with a staff that understands all types of drinks and makes the experience memorable."
2674,"my experience with jw marriott was great. the breakfast spread was excellent and had many choices. the hotel is so active and full of life. it  has many people coming and going all the time. i have stayed here couple of times and i always have enjoyed it.  you always land up seeing some socialite , actor, actress, producer etc over here. the gym was also veryt good. the rooms are very comfortable and has polite staff."
2675,Stayed at the Marriott hotel last night and it was a fab experience.. The hotel room is very good and the staff is amazing! Right from the reception to the pool to the kids club and their cafe all excellent people.. Ganesh at the lotus cafe was extremely friendly and agnes aunty in the kids club was such a warm person to our kids... The breakfast was soo good and the ambiance was so beautiful with the sitar playing in the background.. I think it's one of the best 5 star in mumbai.. Specially with kids.. Tohali from the reception was so warm to the kids.. She took my little son and got him back with whole load of goodies for him n my daughter.. Marriott great job guys !!
2676,"This hotel in Mumbai is really awesome.. Dont want to repeat everything others have said.  right from the front desk staff Ms.Sana to the bell man, everyone behaved as if their only aim in life is to make your stay prefect.   Breakfast Buffet?  Its a heaven of food with a super mix of many cuisines including cusines from many different states in India itself.  Airlins crew stays in this hotel and I saw them at the breakfast and I can easily say they were having an awesome time."
2677,"Stayed at the hotel my medicine bag went missing from the bathroom.  After complaining to about 10 different levels of staff. Nothing was done.  They said they check security cameras etc.  trying to imply we were lying.  In addition a bottle of juice was left open by mistake. within a few hours the whole bedroom on the 5th floor was crawling with pests.  We asked to change room but was placed in another room overnight while pest control was called in. No up grade, refund or apology was offered by any level of staff.  When we checked out I asked to see the manager.  But was told he was not interested. I will be complaining to JW Marriott head office also. This is not 5 star this is indian 5 star."
2678,"difficult to find a flaw in the hotel, location, decor, staff, rooms all are wonderful. stayed for a night only on official trip, not my first time though, but cudn't stop myself from writing a word or two this time. the restaurant is good, spread is wonderful, people are keen to serve you. rooms were functional and decor is nice. only limited complaint is the bedding which was too soft for my liking.  Didnt get the opportunity to use the pool much as I didnt have time, but it looked great from my room. overall a great place to stay. Not much idea about the tariff as it was a corporate stay"
2679,Amazing hotel right on the beach .It was a resort in the city of Mumbai .Excellent staff who would do anything to please you .  Location was the best and rooms were top spec and comfortable .The breakfast was the best and restaurant was the plus point which is open air area and choice was great .  Overall great hotel to stay in Mumbai
2680,"Wonderful hotel, I had a great stay, entire staff was simply amazing, I had dinner in spices just loved the food there, especially salmon sushi and enjoyed the teppanyaki experience with chef Raul olso had dinner in saffron Chef Qureshi makes outstanding Dal makhani and Lamb Chops I really enjoyed the food and service, Thank you for the great experience."
2681,"I highly recommend JW Marriott, Mumbai, simply excellent!  Beautiful rooms, delicious food, not forgetting to mention the variety of food available within the hotel,one the breakfast and lunch spread ive come across, very friendly, highly motivated and efficent staff, can i just mention, puneet, akshay and akanksha (front desk), you made our stay so much more memorable by providing such excellent service. One the best bars in mumbai is located within the hotel called Arola. A must see! i am looking forward to my next visit, very soon!"
2682,"The food is amazing, Service is beautiful and ambiance is brilliant. The Lotus cafe is the place to be at any point of time. Staff are friendly and service is prompt. Good job by everyone. Specially their breakfast is brilliant. My experience with my meal was stunning. Recommend for everyone ."
2683,"Simply a great experience. Been here with family and with girlfriend both, exotic experience. there is a lot to talk about this amazing place. Especially the food in Spices, the chinese restaurant and ofcourse the location from the other end is Simply SERENE. the food is amazing, the refreshers, the deserts and ofcourse the main course the experience overall including the Ambience and the Royal service provided made me and my partner feel special and that is what makes me go there everytime we are up for a dinner."
2684,i must say one of the best experiences i have had for quite some time. the Lounge is Awesome. The staff is so helpful and polite. one f the best people in the hotel industry i have met. clean and neat. waiting for another occasion to be there again.
2685,"I often travel to Mumbai and I must say JW Marriott is a nice hotel to stay in - of course if you have a nice budget for your trip ! JW Marriott offers a great range  of luxurious rooms - from basic standard to executive ones . My favourite bit in JW is that they have a good range of tea set with good variety of tea and coffee in the room . It also offers a  huge variety in breakfast items every morning. from variety of vegetable juices to authentic indian  dishes such as idli, dosa, paratha, salads etc. I like the fact that the chef serves me special grilled chicken in breakfast as i go for a protein diet in the morning.  They also use the high premium  brand mineral water in hotels, rooms - which is very good. unlike in other hotels, you will find low end brands which forces"
2686,"Location, location, location!!!!  This hotel is located over 20 kilometres north of the city centre. It takes about 90 minutes to get to the centre in the rush hour. It is about 6 kilometres for the international airport, and it takes about 35-40 minutes to get there in the rush hour.  So its not central and its not close to the airport. So what is good about its location? It overlooks the Indian ocean. But this is not a beach resort hotel. You cannot swim due to the pollution, and I saw no one sunning themselves on the beach, it looks more like a playground or thoroughfare. Still the hotel has a great pool and deck chairs to relax in, so there is no need to go to the beach. But then you think- well in that case it could be either downtown or by the airport. There is no good"
2687,"This hotel is in the suburbs of Mumbai not the city itself. But if you're here to shop, see family, or explore the authentic food, this is the place to stay, especially if you're coming from the States. Friendly staff, amazing breakfast buffet where the chef makes anything you want, and beautiful rooms. We had a little trouble using our BA avios but the general manager was accommodating. Be prepared for heavy security when you enter the hotel but this was honestly a lovely vacation attributed to this hotel."
2688,"Me and my wife stayed at this property checked in on 29th june 2013 evening. Right from airport pick up, everything was very well taken care of. Thanks to Miss Toholia for being such a nice host. This was the last property of our this year vacations, starting with leela Chennai to taj madikeri to taj bekal. But out of all of these J W Marriott tops our list, with the sort of services rendered by them. The rooms, the lobby , the restaurant, the spa , the pool,everything was great. My special mention at the management of restaurant ,buffet breakfast and sunday brunch is commendable. The whole team of this restaurant is very nicely placed and making things effective as a great unit. Thanks to mr mannu. My special thanks to Miss Poonam chauhan. All the best to the Marriott team."
2689,"I've stayed at the JW Marriott on five or six separate visits to Mumbai, after trying the Taj Land's End (very good), the Sun and Sand and a couple of others. The JW Marriott is on a higher level entirely. It's a massive place, a grand hotel with a lobby and downstairs dining area that can seem cavernous, but also inspiring.  My room on my most recent stay (June, 2013) was a renovated one -- the hotel is in the midst of a long renovation -- and very comfortable. Luxury touches like an espresso machine were welcome.  The service was excellent, if a bit overdone by western standards. I've learned that extremely attentive service is normal in hotels like this in India, and have managed to let staff know when to step back a bit.  The only flaws I noticed were a few flies in the main"
2690,This hotel is excellent in everything. I stayed seven night in business. The room is premier executive club. Though it was expensive but it worth it. The business center was very helpful and supportive.
2691,"This hotel is an escape from looking at the awful poverty in Mumbai;....I am not used to seeing this much poverty and staying at the lovely Marriott is rather embarrassing.  The hotel is lovely, the food is nice and the gym is great as is the spa. Just embarrassing to be able to go here and see the total poverty throughout the city. Can't fault the hotel with the way Mumbai looks...just the two extremes are hard to deal with....those who can afford this hotel and those who can't.  The gym is very nice, the food is good, and the small gift shop/food store is nice too. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Customer service is nice too."
2692,"This hotel does it all right! It's a compound a tad distance from the heart of town(30 minutes, no traffic) but that keeps it away from danger also. The security seems good and they appear to care. The rooms are nice, great pool, great workout room, the food is excellent. The ATM didn't work, but I assume that problem will be fixed. I would stay there again and for an extended vacation, it's perfect. The views are of a pond/lagoon, very peaceful."
2693,"Jw Stands Out from the world of Organised chaos. As soon as you come in from the huge lobby door, you tend leave the rush life behind and it lets you relax. I specially like The Spices restaurant which serves pan asian cuisine with array of tepan-yaki style. Would Love to go back any day."
2694,Well I stayed 3 nights with my disabled mum and dad and we stayed at 15 more hotels in India after this one all of the same standard and I will say this hotel wins overall from bedding and room comfort to location and service and their hospitality to my mum with their experienced staff and one more thing on the day we left the hotel gave us a book of water bottles to take on our journey to Pune our next stop well how lovely I would come back here again THANKYOU jw
2695,"Have stayed here for several years due to the variety of restaurants, relatively safe walking & shopping and on the beach. Hotel has been going through renovation so half of the hotel is not available.  Great staff and restaurants (Spanish, Italian, Asian and India plus the huge buffet). Only issue is the Disco has opened which is directly over the SPA, so if you intend to have a massage when open or they are holding an event - not so peaceful.  I cancelled my massage on a Sunday afternoon as they had an event. Staff was good to have told me in advance."
2696,"I have been staying the JW over the past 11 years on trips to India from Australia for business and must have stayed here at least 40 or 50 times. Before the refurbishment this hotel had fallen well behind the other 5 star Mumbai hotels. The job they have done is absolutely wonderful and they have at the same time retained the charm of the hotel. The rooms now are modern , functional and comfortable. Food and beverage are first class and this hotel has definitely returned to the list of top hotels."
2697,My husband and I booked a night in the Juhu JW Marriott to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  It was a disappointment.    The reservation process was painful.  We had a discount voucher as we had recently signed up to the Marriott Club at the hotel.  It took no less than 10 calls to secure the booking.  No one knew how to deal with the voucher and no one took responsibility to sort it out.  On check- in we were offered a recently refurbished room - it was very small and the sea view was only of a couple of  pigeons and a tiny slither of beach. Because it was our anniversary we were given flower and a cake which was lovely but as we started to use the room we noticed things.The bedside lights did not work which the technician finally  managed to get working after 2 attempts but
2698,"Very good location, on the beach with gorgeous views of the ocean. Also, within 20 mins from the airport makes it a good base for both business and leisure. Situated in an uscale suburb of mumbai with good shopping within 10 mins. Here are some specific notes:  General condition : good but a little bit tired and not as great as the ITC's in mumbai. Lobby and main areas are bright, spacious and good for meetings etc.   Rooms: very good, recently done up and has all the facilities needed. Recommendation is to get an ocean facing room. Bathrooms are good size and the beds are comfortable.  Gym: excellent and very big  Pool area: good with a decent sized pool in front of the beach. I think i also saw a kids pool adjacent to the pool are.  Restaurants: a number of different"
2699,Great location for any traveller in Mumbai. Close to the famous Juhu area. Excellent restaurants and cafe for any business meetings. The service is top class. Great place to organize events and conferences.
2700,"J W by far is the finest hotel in the Suburbs of Mumbai. It has well appointed rooms. It has a very grand lobby and offers a very luxurious feel.The Italian restaurant is very good, BBC at lobby level offers great food for anytime of the day. Location of the hotel is unbeatable, situated right on the Juhu Beach. People staying here can walk down to Prithvi Theatre where many good plays are regularly performed."
2701,"The Hotel was magnificent and its landscape was simply breathtaking , had a conference for about 150 people and the experience was outstanding  with every participants praising the hotel for the presentation and service. The staff execution was simply brilliant and made the conference a great success"
2702,"Hotel is good n clean but there is no consistency in the service. Our first trip was excellent however on our second trip, After every room service we ordered, we were asked to pay cash every time as according to them there was no credit in our account, (usually there's an option to add room services charges to the room bill and pay when u check out) it got really annoying.   When we ordered dinner again,  same issue came up, we lost it n called duty manager but it was a waste of time n energy talking to him as he was good for nothing. The catch is sometimes the room service delivery boys do it deliberately so that they get instant tips thats what we felt coz after every cash payment forced on us we would not take the change back...   If u go to Marriott, be aware u gotto make"
2703,"We were personally welcomed by the manager, Vikram, upon check in. He took us for a tour of the property and made every effort to ensure that we looked after. The service was great all the way from the drivers through to the restaurant staff. On one morning we completed the breakfast feedback form and rated the tea as a 3 out of 5. The breakfast manager came to our table to apologise and query how to make it better. The next morning, while the floor was busy with guests having breakfast, someone somehow remebered how we liked our tea served and brought it to us without even requesting it.  Our room was also very comfortable with all the mod cons you would expect.  The location was okay but easy enough to get around with a driver."
2704,"Close to Juhu beach, with a great Asian restaurant, but this property is not quite a 5 star JW Marriott.  The hotel needs some updating (a knob fell off the door while I was in the business center), and the Hotel lacks a recent bar, but the staff tries hard and the property has such tight security, it almost became annoying.  Also disappointing is that the beautiful pool area has a bar, but it does not serve alcohal.  Overall, I will return, but only for short stays."
2705,This hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the Mumbai Airport.  The in house restaurant has really good indian food.  Wifi is free and so is breakfast.  The rooms are decent size and the bed is comfortable.
2706,"My stay in the hotel was only for a night and I did not spend too much time in the hotel so the review is only on my first impression, which however is excellent! The hotel is built on a slope so while on front it looks like a low rise building, it goes down at the back 2 stories to level with the beach. The lobby is so made that the whole of back wall is glass and you get to see the sea and the beach the moment you enter the lobbt. breathtaking view. Very polite and cordial staff. Check-in was a pleasant affair.   The decor is very Art oriented. From lobby to corridors to rooms, digitally printed canvasses adorn the plain walls creating a very interesting effect. Rooms are small but very nice and modern. Beds are king size with snoozer mattresses and very soft cushions and"
2707,"A good hotel. Stayed here as part of an offsite session. Regretted as I was staying on the first floor, right above their discotheque. The vibration and the music was too loud and I could hardly sleep. Overall a good hotel, but the night was terrible for me. Others in the group had a good time though."
2708,"The best hotel in all aspects!! The rooms are well designed, well equipped, staff is smart and very cooperative. This hotel gives the true sense of Indian hospitality. Food is of great taste and ambiance was too.  In short gives true experience of Royal life."
2709,"We frequently stay at this hotel but every time  we stay here it is an experience to remember. The hotel is exceptionally clean and conveniently located on Juhu beach. The rooms are very well appointed, clean and well kept. The staff has an heart of gold and gives you a true feeling of Indian Hospitality which is embedded in that culture. Over all great experience."
2710,"Most things in the man made world lie on either side of a thin line; the line that defines good or bad, to us - humans.  the best thing about the Marriott is the service, attention to individual details. for instance, the temperature knob of my shower, was left as is, after the first day after i put it to my liking. another thing could be the little notes left in my room by the desk or floor manager. also, the height of the table lamp wasn't changed after i set it. (you can also call this lack of attention by the staff, but lets give them the benefit). they also went out of their way to cater to our business needs.   also, the breakfast and lunch buffet is pretty elaborate. the location is also good. if you are a Bollywood fan, you will cherish being here, as you can definitely"
2711,Roughly half the hotel is currently under construction so be aware.   Location is very central and the restaurants are very good.   The benefit for many is the beach location and the stunning views provided is a real plus.
2712,"The JW Marriott in Mumbai is a relatively large hotel located on the Indian Ocean near the Mumbai airport.  The hotel is in a U shape with rooms either facing into the pool area or outside to the surrounding area.  I booked what I thought was the nicest room: ""Premier Club, Executive lounge access, Larger Guest room, King, Pool access"" and found that this room faced not towards the pool area but towards the outside.  This was extremely disappointing - it was loud and a generally unpleasant view.  In addition - I was given a room right next to the elevator which I specifically requested NOT to be given.  I was told that the rooms facing the ocean were not available - even though I booked the most expensive room!  My primary issue with the hotel however was the car service.  We"
2713,"With a 6 month old kid, we decided to spend our wedding anniversary in Mumbai itself and chose JW Marriott for a weekend stay.   The Lobby area completely wins you over with its elevated view of the Arabian Sea.  The staff is very attentive and professional.  There was initial hesitation regarding our upgrade request.  But once they found out about our anniversary, things changed compeltely.   We got a surprise upgrade to the Ocean view Suite, on the topmost floor.  It was completely fabulous with views of the Juhu beach and the sea from the sitting room, bedroom and the master bathroom.  We also got a lovely lily boquet and an exquisite chocolate cake, with compliments from the hotel.  It was already becoming very memorable.  The suite was really well done, freshly renovated"
2714,"Stayed here on business for second time  Service is outstanding!  Feels like a happy place to work for the super-attentive staff, who either enjoy working for Marriott or put on a very good act!  Luxurious and scrupulously clean, lovely room and great restaurants, the buffet restaurant having some of the best curry dishes I have ever eaten!  Also hosts Sergi Arulo Spanish restaurant which is really excellent  Travelled on business but now I want to take the wife!!"
2715,"I hav stayed there this year , my experience was good , i was not upset wit decision staying there , loved the ambiance of hotel specially Fire Blow near pool side was awesome at night , services was better and nice then any of other Marriott . Aarora rest was quite cool to go and sit sea side and cherrish lovely food with drinks , it was nice day spend and was happy by serivces provided there ."
2716,"Just back from a flying tour of India (very small scale!) in which I saw two very different sides to Mumbai - much like it's name change might hint at.  For the first stop over before flying to Kerala we stayed at the Four Seasons. Good hotel, made better by the excellent staff, but not a great location. So on our return to Mumbai to catch our plane home to London we stayed closer to the airport in Juhu Beach at the Marriott.  As we'd spent the last week chilling in Goa we thought it might be nice to have a beach location in the city instead of soaking up the mayhem of Mumbai - as we did at the start of the holiday. We were not disappointed. This side of Mumbai feels like a million miles away from the city I landed in at the beginning of our stay. It might have been my"
2717,"My husband and I have stayed in many 5 * resorts all over the world! The unique quality of this hotel is that it takes ' takes your breath away '. We were awestruck from the moment we entered! The hospitality of all staff goes beyond description. Just as another reviewer mentioned, there is staff member literally waiting at your beck and call. They cannot do enough for you!  Even though there is major renovations going on in the hotel, guests do not see or hear anything.  The 5th floor had stunning views of the ocean, pool and gardens. Even though we stayed in the smokers rooms, being non smokers, we normally cannot stand the smell, but, I must admit, it was absolutely smell free.  The buffet breakfast is out of this world. With live music performances during meal times, there"
2718,Well I stayed 3 nights with my disabled mum and dad and we stayed at 15 more hotels in India after this one all of the same standard and I will say this hotel wins overall from bedding and room comfort to location and service and their hospitality to my mum with their experienced staff and one more thing on the day we left the hotel gave us a book of water bottles to take on our journey to Pune our next stop well how lovely I would come back here again THANKYOU jw
2719,"Room are standard, at least on lower floors, sea view is great, stay and food is overpriced compared to other Marriott hotels and the standards available, probably you pay the price of being in the location close to Bollywood celebrity dwellings ..."
2720,I stayed with my wife. The hotel was very nice and the entrance to the hotel looks amazing. Room are spacious and very clean. The view from the hotel is exceptional. I very much liked this hotel and would definitely travel again.
2721,"This hotel has lovely grounds, however the rooms are very cluttered and look like an Ikea showroom. Why oh why  is it so hard to put a flat sheet between the duvet? And both beds in my room did not have mattress pads. The rooms also have bizarre abstract paintings of men throughout. The guest rooms do not reflect an India feel at all. What a shame in such a culturally beautiful city. The front desk staff can't really seem to bothered and the club within in the hotel, Enigma, is very loud and can be heard in first floor guest rooms. The spa is terribly outdated, good luck getting a locker and the changing room looks like a1970' era bath house with an undertone mildew smell. And don't miss the odd display of a mannequin behind glass submerged in water. Yes my basic needs were"
2722,"I stayed with my wife for 2night...hotel has advantage of Juhu ONLY.  Rooms are very tinny, not good if you are travelling with Family/kids..  another drawback is traffic...hotel road is normally stuck on peek time..."
2723,"This is clearly a 5 star hotel.  The facilities and service left nothing to be desired.  Every time we saw a staff member, including all levels of management (include the hotel General Manager), their first question was ""Is there anything I can do for you?""  And on those rare occasions when we answered in the affirmative, they proceeded to do that immediately.  The food serviced was excellent in all of the several dining facilities we tried in our four days there.    The Executive Lounge is undergoing renovation but they provided more than comparable service using other existing facilities within the hotel.  The location is such that it backs up to Juno Beach, which is great for both swimming and non-water beach activities. The hotel is located closer to the airports than the"
2724,This was my 5th visit to Marriott in as many years. I have found this hotel meeting all the expectations that you may have from a 5* property.   Presently (as of Feb end 2013) the hotel is undergoing a major renovation but this does not have any impact on the stay.  I did not get an opportunity to use the fitness center/ Spa during my last stay however I have used the facilities earlier and have found them to be very top of the line.  The swimming pool is very large and there are ample of sun loungers around. There is a separate kid's pool as well.  The buffet breakfast is of top quality and consists of one of the best spreads that you could find in any 5* property! The staff manning the breakfast area are exceptionally good and take good care of you! There are many live cooking
2725,Spent only one night on this trip but will be back again as business dictates.  This property is pretty conveniently located to both the domestic and the international airport terminals - about a half hour ride.  There are several very good hotels within minutes of the international terminal but the extra few minutes that it takes to get to the Marriott was not critical for me.   The hotel arranges transportation very efficiently.  No waiting at the airport and the car is available at the requested time when leaving the hotel.  Staff is excellent  with efficient check in / check out as well having experienced excellent service in the restaurant for the one meal I had at the hotel.  Food was of reasonable quality and fresh (breakfast).  The beach is absolutely beautiful and my
2726,"Fantastic hotel and excellent service from all the staff members.  I would highly recommend this hotel for those who want to visit Mumbai.   Service is beyond excellent, the staff at the reception were very helpful namely Imran and Avinash. They went beyond there duty to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Also, Sarthik in the Reflections bar was extremely helpful and friendly.  I will be definately visiting again in the near future.  Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2727,"You get what you expect when you stay here - comfort, good service, great food (AMAZING breakfast buffet)!  I stayed here before I knew Mumbai very well but now that I do, I prefer to stay in lower cost options in Bandra."
2728,"I travelled to Mumbai in January for a quick break & had the option to stay @ JW Marriot or the Taj, I decided to stay @ JW.   Firstly some great staff great you at reception. The hotel is under renovation, however this does not affect your stay at all, and it‚Äôs well kept out of the way. The rooms are decent, but for the price you pay I would expect a bit more. I would certainly not expect to look out of the window & see a pile of bird droppings disgusting, how can they allow this for supposedly one of the best hotels in India? Please see my pictures. Don‚Äôt say the rooms are high up etc, I was in Maui, Hawaii a few months prior to this, & the room was high up there‚Ä¶nothing like this, just disgusting.   The food in this hotel is marvellous, I can‚Äôt complain at the breakfast was"
2729,"By Bombay standards, quite a big property by the sea, rooms are fine, not very spacious but decent enough. meets basic expectations, not much luxury.  close to airport, rooms offer a small view to the sea, so some thing refreshing to look out in the mornings.  the health club is preety far and not very easy to reach,   the breakfast is great, and the music played in the morning is also soothing.  room service is slow."
2730,"From the moment you arrive this hotel impresses one. The early Minoan decor at the entry and pool area is somewhat unusual and impart an old world feel to what is a decidedly modern hotel.   The rooms have been recently redone , hardwood floors, comfortable beds and up to the minute bathrooms , marble lined with two showers, conventional and rain.   The pool area has a large infinity pool and another separate one for children. The pool area lets onto the beach through a secured gate. The beach at dawn and dusk  are a slice of India at its best. Grandfathers with grand kids, youngsters playing cricket, lovers hand in hand taking the air.   There is a large airy dining area , various bars and restaurants and a surprisingly good deli and bookshop available too. Staff are"
2731,"The hotel is in the midst of a refurbishment, but you would hardly know.  I had the advantage of a refurbished executive room which is both stylish and comfotable - a major imporvement on my last stay four years ago.  Each member of the hotel staff I have interacted with has been polite, helpful and eager to achieve high standards. Over a five day stay, the number of staff who took the trouble to learn my name and use it was remarkable.  I commend particuarly the staff on the ""Refections"" bar, which is serving temporarily as the executive lounge during the refurbishment.  The welcome from the front desk on arrival was warm, and the reception formalities were dealt with in an efficent and friendly way.  The concierge desk staff were helpful and efficient in arranging cars to take"
2732,"A rare beachfront 5 star Luxury Property in Mumbai, this undoubtedly is one of the best properties in town. The beachfront is clearly unique, because very few Mumbai hotels have access to a sandy beach. It is a large property, with several great restaurants, a good pool, a fantastic fitness centre and also a good spa. Service is impeccable, room rates now are more affordable than what it used to be 2 years earlier.  The garden is beautifully landscaped, leading into the pool and the beach. it also has a happening night club, though I did not personally get a chance to see it."
2733,"Being a Mumbaikar, have walked passed million times across this Juhu Masterpiece....had a been there for Coffee visits....but finally in April 2012, Attended a 2 day international conference in here.....and then it was understood why all the Bollywood biggies and stars are here around....In fact in those two days saw around 4-5 Bollywood celebrities....  The best feature in JW Marriott is the Grand Indo-Western Architecture, Superb color combis perfected by Juhu Beach view....As expected, Food is awesome.,,one shouldn't miss the coffee here and even various bakery items....  Main Restaurant itself is another Classy and huge structure....but given the chance, one may opt for Lotus cafe....All together, if you want to spend a leisure holiday in Mumbai for 3-4 days, you must opt"
2734,I have been here couple of times.The food is just outstanding at various restaurants in it. But my personal best is Lotus cafe. The view is quite amazing during day as you are facing pool and beach. Buffet us served there which is extraordinary.  If you want to taste Indian food you can head to saffron or try Italian at Messo Messo.  Even the bakery BBC is amazing in itself.Caring staff and can spend quality time over there.
2735,We stayed for 3 nights and were extremely satisfied with this hotel. The staff was very helpful and assisted us in all matters. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast had a lot of dishes and was good. The checkin and checkout was breeze. Overall was a good stay at this hotel.
2736,"This is our third time back within the space of a year!  Cannot fault this hotel, right from when you walk in you are greeted with a smile. The staff are so friendly and won't be forgotten, a big thank you to Imran, anjali and Avinash from front desk who looked after us. Prabhukar and mr Lopez from dining are always a pleasure to talk to. Reflections bar is amazing with a great ocean view whilst sipping on cocktails watching the sun go down. Mario, Sartak, Ravi and prasool looked after us. They even kindly bought out some yoghurt and rice for my mum when she was poorly. I haven't stayed at a hotel like this which cares so much for their guests! My mother and father enjoyed their aniversary thanks to the staff at MARRiot juhu for making their aniversary a memorable one, With"
2737,"This had to be oneof the best hotels ever.  The service was 7 star!  Upon check-in they took me on a tour to point out all the areas including the pool as I was looking for a co-worker.  They took me to my room personally too.  I just can't say enough about the service...other than the same goes for all over India...they need to learn to upsell beer around the pool area.  I have to go ask, they never inquire if I want something but this seems to be a cultural thing.  The food especially at the Italian restaurant is simply outstanding.  I have never had homemade pasta that actually tasted that fresh.  And the bakery/sandwich/coffee shop had the best croissants ever!  The only downside was the size of the room (compared to other places in Mumbai) is a bit smaller and has ajoining"
2738,"The hotel is located vƒõry well , The hotel is simply amazing with vƒõry warm welcome , The checkin process was fast with delighted and motivated eam , The rooms  are big with big washrooms and great ambience , The in room dining food is good  , The restaurants are against good with good food and service , The hotel stay is value for money"
2739,"This hotel is one of the best in the Marriott chain. It offers luxury, great service, Cleanliness, great food, and hospitality that is superb. It certainly has made the difference in our stay. The chef, Stany Lopes, And ma√Ætre d', Prabu Acharya came over several times during our meals. The wait staff were pleasant, friendly, and attentive. We would highly recommend this hotel."
2740,"This hotel offers first class comfort, courtesy, excellent service and beautiful views of the ocean beach. The front office staff was unbelievably courteous, efficient. The rooms were very comfortable with all amenities, super house keeping and perfect bell captain service. the outstanding feature of my stay was the superb courtesy and warmth offered by the front desl professionals. The airport taxi service was efficient and in uptodate newer model car."
2741,"We stayed at the Marriott for six nights and the hotel was a harbor of calm in a very hectic and crowded city. The hotel is beautiful with wonderful pools for swimming and relaxing. It is on the beach if you like to stroll or run, but the water quality is questionable for swimming for non-locals. The highlight of the hotel is the staff. Everyone is friendly, helpful and solicitous. I looked forward to the buffet breakfast every day which offered excellent selections in every category from western to Indian. We had dinner there one night and that was excellent too, as was our dinner in their Indian restaurant, Safron. I read complaints that the rooms were small. Ours was certainly an acceptable size with a lovely ocean view. My only reservation in recommending this property is if"
2742,"We stayed here with our 2 year old, the hotel is great although the rooms are a little tiny.  But over all the staff was very friendly and efficient with our check in and great with our 2 year old, The buffet breakfast was fantastic and the chef gladly accommodated our special diet... It was wonderful... The airport drop off was a breeze... All in all we would definitely go back there. The location of this hotel is great wih direct access to the beach. We did not use the pool cause it was raining the most part, but it looked so inviting... Lovely!!!!!!"
2743,So... We are on he preferred member scheme of j. W . Marriott mumbai I am to believe when j w attaches his name to a property it's like god saying its heaven !!!!!  Alas .. Gods ave fallen .... Even for preffered members who pay US $ 550 annually to be preferred???? are treated like walk in clients.....  Poor service   Poor hospitability  Poor J W......  Another one bites the dust !!!!  Italian Restaurant managers gave attitude while taking orders  They were not child friendly ... Not even accommodating food order for children on table !!!!!!!!!  Pool staff was excellent  Chech in superb  Concierge top line  Support staff......... Quetionable ??????
2744,"Great location, walk to the beach from hotel, many choices in  breakfast, Like the service, nice comfortable bed. Rooms are small but it's worth it for the price Staff are very helpful. Had airport pick up very efficient"
2745,"I was incredibly excited to book 7 nights in a deluxe room at the Marriott hotel. The entrance is grand along with the foyer which you can't sit in for more than 5 mins as it is freezing! Overall for what we paid per night absolutely disappointing. Room was TINY! Absolute disgrace for what we paid, no room to open suitcases or anything. For such an expensive hotel I would expect rooms to have been better than that. Also there was talk of many celebrities around but never saw one! I had always conveniently missed them and was unsure about claims made from staff whether they were true.  The jacuzzi/Sauna area is old and disgusting! Old towels, old lockers area didn't seem clean was so disappointed. Gym was great however no complaints and the lotus cafe and restaurants amazing.  I"
2746,"JW Marriott is on Juhu beach, it has diect access tot he beach and is in walking distance of all the local hustle and bustle that goes on in the evenings.  The hotel itself has the friendliest staff, well equipped rooms and the food is fantastic.  You can have many items made to order and the chef is always about to make sure you are happy.  The only down side is the fact that a whole wing of the hotel is being renovated at the moment and so the executive lounge is out of use, and the pool attracts a number of crows, which made it extremely dirty, and I dared not go in!"
2747,"I have been attending conferences and events in your hotel since almost ten years.   Though service remains impeccable, the cause of concern is the gradual rise in insensitivity towards vegetarians in your hotel. In India, and particularly in a cosmopolitan city like Mumbai, even many non-vegetarians have vegetarian food on certain days of the week.   I was attending a conference on February 21, 2013. Most of the main course and salads served did have ‚Äú(Vegetarian)‚Äù tag but desserts did not have, there was no green dot either.  When I checked with your steward there, I was told that two desserts are eggless and all others are with egg. Ice-creams are generally perceived to be without egg in India (except for one or two international brands), but I could see non-vegetarian"
2748,"JW Marriot is by far the worst experience in terms of service and professionalism. I stayed here for my first night after my weddnig and let me tell you it worse than pathetic. The reception had no idea that i was staying here after my wedding, even though it was mentioned at the time of booking. They promised me a lowdown, where they would provide cake and wine. There was no wine in the room and the cake mentioned ""Happy Birthday"" on it, and worse than that, the cake had a fly on it. The room was in a full mess, I think JW Marriot should re consider there entire management. I called to talk to the GM, who was unavailable for his guests, no idea what the GM is doing there in the first place. Rooms are extremely small and superly over priced. 2 star hotels in Mumbai are much"
2749,"A large hotel right on the beach front (although behind security fence). Book sea facing room as great to watch the many locals going about their daily activities. Good base for a few nights stay in Mumbai, as feel that you escape the chaos but the main town is just a 45 min drive away (due to traffic). We used local taxi rather than pay hotel taxi which was 3x the price ! He was good as took / meet us to where we wanted, knew some other local sights and did not hassle us to go to any shoppping emporiums. There are 4 restaurants to choose from - we tried the buffet and Indian and both very very good. Although the Exec Lounge is under renovation, the alternative arrangement in the bar was fine and food selection and quality v good. The beach is crowded, quite dirty and sea too"
2750,This hotel we have booked for a two days conference. The conference room provided was very good which could accommodate about 10 ‚Äì 15 people. The staffs assisting us were very friendly and were at for our help throughout the meeting. I would say this is an ideal place for conducting a business meeting or any kind of training. Only the projector seems to be bit costly on a daily rent and if a 5 days meeting is been organized then a new projector could be bought for that rate. The buffet lunch provided was above the expectations and its worth for the money they you pay. If you are willing to try all the menu items then you many need a help to get up from your chair.
2751,"We picked JW Marriott in Juhu, Bombay, to celebrate my parents' 50th anniversary.  The location and ambiance could not have been better. The hotel is on the beach and when you are in the hotel it is easy to forget you the madding crowds and traffic of Bombay. The ocean views from the rooms are very relaxing and soothing as is the beautiful landscaping of the lawn, meandering lotus pond and swimming pool. I was unwell so I could not use the swimming pool but I really wish I could have - it was large enough to do laps in two directions and to also accommodate people who just wanted to relax in the water. The JW Marriott staff was simply amazing. Very gracious and attentive without being overly intrusive.  My sister was sitting in the Lotus cafe, when one of the attendants told her"
2752,"The rooms were clean, quiet and of good size.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast buffet was one of the most generous that I have come across, and beautifully presented.  The restaurant has very high ceilings and looks out over the pool area with the ocean beyond.  This hotel is truly an oasis in a very busy and crowded city."
2753,The hotel has one of the biggest lobbies in India. The Rooms in have all the amenities which is standard to marriot. The buffet is a very elaborate affair with lot of dishes. It is better to have a sea facing room and also you can take a walk on the beach. The rooms are a little smaller compared to other marriot hotels in India.
2754,"I have been a regular guest at this Hotel---but during this visit in February 2013--the housekeeping standards appear to have declined--no coffee sachets or milk in the room--though coffeemaker and tea bags and sugar are kept !   Overall, the exteriors also appear to need some attention--especially on the beach-facing side !  the food continues to be good."
2755,"My wife and I spent a week at the JWM from the 4th January to the 11th January.My 3 previous trips to Mumbai were at the Taj Group of Hotels.The first stay at the excellent Taj at the Gateway of India,Colaba.The two  stays thereafter were at the Taj Lands End in Bandra.This time we decided to stay at JWM.Situated on Juhu beach,a great location,if you like to take your morning jog or walk on the beach.The hotel is super luxury.When you enter it is simply overwhelming.The foyer is majestic and the service is impeccable.Very well maintained and the rooms are stunning.Make sure you book a room facing the sea as the view is excellent.This is a resort hotel.The staff are just unbelievable and they are willing to assist in everyway.The breakfast spread is the finest I have come accross"
2756,Hotel provides best class facility . Rooms were very good with most comfortable beds i have ever  slept on.I also appreciate the security measures taken for the customers. I had a very nice time at this place with my family. Enjoyed a lot. Want to come back again.
2757,"I've stayed at the JW Marriott in Mumbai several times and have found the service to be consistently excellent. For a New Yorker it feels a bit over the top, but that's my problem, not theirs :-). The staff, at every level and function, are exceedingly friendly, attentive and deliver competently.  Every request, small or large, is responded to expeditiously and with style. The hotel itself is well maintained; the rooms are modern and nicely outfitted.  The restaurants are very good, albeit expensive. For Western folk unaccustomed to Indian cuisine and who don't want to worry what they can eat safely, rest assured that the quality standards at this hotel are equal to five star hotels in New York, Paris, London, etc.  Other facilities are also top notch. As a swimmer, I love the"
2758,"I have had an amazing 11 nights at the Marriott and intend to make this an annual holiday place. Even though there are some negatives the positives far outweigh them. On booking I did request a room on the 4th floor as the reviews here were recommending this - unfortunately we got  dusty room 135, on day 4 we were offered a room on the 4th floor as the vibration from the nightclub can be heard in our room, as there were 3 of us and repacking was going to be an issue we declined. Please note the balcony outside this room is huge I don't think we could access it but we had a shock when we saw a member of staff walking past our window, after this we kept our curtains closed, as we were not in the room during the day it was not a huge issue. Food wise a few issues in the bakery when"
2759,I stayed in this hotel in August 2012.We loved the lobby and the entrance.I also appreciate the security measures taken for the customers.However the best part that I liked about this hotel was the poolside area.The family had a very nice time at this place.The room was also amazing specially the washrooms.I enjoyed my stay thoroughly.
2760,We arrived at the Marriott with a per booking .. The check in was very quick and the baggage was transferred automatically from the x ray screening by hotel staff .. We got a room overlooking to sea .. We ordered for dinner in the room .. The service was quick and we were served on a table with inbuilt heater to keep the food hot .. It was our aniversary so they had arranged cake for us with flowers . It was an amazing stay .. The staff and security was good.. It's pool is fabulous .. Our kids also loved the kids pool  all over it was a great stay
2761,The entrance is grand and has a lovely ambience!  Had the buffet dinner which had a huge spread with the tastiest dishes. The desserts were mouth watering and delicious  The pool area looks stunning and the hotel has a good night club
2762,"This hotel is our home every time we visit Mumbai. Located in Juhu, its close to all the great attractions including homes to some of the bollywood celebrities! All restaurants are highly recommended. Lotus cafe has one of the best buffet breakfast! As always staff is very courteous and professional. Hotel cars are worth every penny also."
2763,"I stayed here during a conference. The location is absolutely fantastic facing the sea. The spa, swimming pool and Gym are one of the best. You can see a lot of Bollywood celebrities at the spa or health club. The food is outstanding. Just one sad part is that the rooms could have been bigger."
2764,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Clean and well appointed. The hotel was undergoing some significant renovations in one wing, but that didn't cause any issue. The buffet is quite extensive - one of the best I've seen in a while. Very personable staff. Spectacular pool and a great view of the beach!  The wine bar/tapas bar Arola had a great atmosphere. The bakery and bookstore near the lobby was excellent!  Some of the hallways were over perfumed with deodoriser, but it was only a minor annoyance in what was a great hotel."
2765,"Great location on the beach with all the quality and services that you would expect. The rooms are great with half having sea views. The breakfast has the largest choice I have ever seen in a hotel and the quality is top. The service is great, friendly and about the right amount attention. I had to extend my stay by 2 days and no problem at all. Managed to stay in the same room, they just made it happen."
2766,We recently stayed in this Marriott property whilst visiting Mumbai. The hotel is excellent. The rooms and service we can't fault. All the staff and house keeping we're very helpful. The chef presented his own card and said he would be happy to make anything or our 12month baby. The only problem is the hotel is a very busy hotel. The majority of the guest visiting the hotel were not residents of the hotel. It was very irritating to wait and cue outside for security every time we entered the hotel just because we had 10 to 15 people in front of us. I feel the hotel needs to give priority to residents or have a separate entrance. After all we have paid money to stay there and enjoy the facilities. Hence we should not be given second priority. As we all know there is no cuing
2767,"Great location on the beach with all the quality and services that you would expect. The rooms are great with half having sea views. The breakfast has the largest choice I have ever seen in a hotel and the quality is top. The service is great, friendly and about the right amount attention. I had to extend my stay by 2 days and no problem at all. Managed to stay in the same room, they just made it happen."
2768,Juhu Beach was my favorite place of weekly visit during my childhood days. The Jw Marriot Mumbai has been built in the location my family and friends used to spend our sunday afternoons in. The ambiance of its layout and accessability to the beach brings back fond memories. Raza and Gurmeet have been a pleasure to communicate with. Raza has been transferred to Jaipur and am not sure about Gurmeet. The food is good and my friends who live close by can visit me easily. The newly renovated area is also of my liking and taste I enjoy my stay here. Feels Like home away from home. The floor staff is very pleasant God Bless these Kids.
2769,"JW Marriot Mumbai is a beautiful hotel and great service. The hotel is well presented at looks fantastic. it has an excellent atmosphere and when you walk around you feel you are in a top hotel.   The staff Vikram, Ghaynesham and Ashish there's is 3 other front desk member of staff from front desk which are always willing to help and be accommodating to all needs that are requested of them.  Always will visit and being a great place to stay.  Thanks,  RK"
2770,Needs extensive makeover .the bar in the lobby has 2 bar stools and limited variety of beverages. I believe it's named 'reflections' Rooms are the same as 10 years ago. Needs new furniture and mattresses .
2771,"Greatly enjoyed visit to Mumbai. Hotel was great! Clean with excellent staff. Food very tasty, Beautiful grounds. One downside was amount of security to get inside but since it was for our protection we adjusted"
2772,We have for 6 nights from 28th December through New years and this place was magical. The property itself was of high quality and something you would expect from a 5 star establishment.  What sets this hotel apart from others I've stayed in is the service. Staff all over the hotel are willing to help and always greet us to make us special  There is nothing I can fault. If I had to be picky then there are building works going on so some facilities are limited and building noise can be heard during the day. But all hotels need renovation and it was our bad luck we travelled during this period  Highly recommended
2773,We organized a conference in the ball room and the only thing I can say is that I was very satisfied with this hotel. I just have little time to enjoy the hotel facilities but everything I tried was great. Food is amazing and the stuff is very friendly and happy to help. The only cons is the room was small although it wasn't important for me because I was away during the day.
2774,it is in the best location near the Juhu Beach and not far from Airport. Atmosphere of the hotel is superb and the staff are just too good and very friendly.  Food was amazingly good and very enjoyed our stay and would visit them again in future.
2775,"I enjoy the ambiance and the service of the Hotel. Staff is also very helpful and sweet. They are very particular about their time. The location is also superb, my room had a beach view, it was so amazing seeing sunset everyday. It was very convenient to locate whenever we had gone out for shopping and stuff. My overall experience at that Hotel was just amazing i had enjoyed my vacation to the core."
2776,Very well located hotel..right next to Juhu beach. The distance from the airport is not so far but it takes long time to reach hotel during the day (especially during office hours). The food ia amazing and sunday brunch (though littel expensive) is awesome. Overall stay was very good.
2777,"If you expect a good night's sleep at a 5* hotel of this calibre don't check in for a weekend stay. At 1-30 am I invited the duty manager into my room to witness my second night of the mirror-rattling, lamp-shaking experience of the Enigma Night Club which is four floors down from my room. The Marriott Management seem to have lost sight of what a hotel means to its staying guest in favour of compromising tranquility for an unspeakably inappropriate night club. My sympathies lie with the local residents whose beautiful old houses back onto the club a mere stone's throw away from the club itself and the ubiquitous outdoor smoking area which simply opens the club to the outside. There is no noise control and no thought whatsoever for non-club goers. To the Marriott owners and"
2778,"I travel to Mumbai often to work and thought would give this hotel a try. Everything from the check-in was a disaster - 1. I had a confirmed reservation for a non-smoking room, which, as it turned out, wasn't available. 2. It took about 20 minutes to check-in and then when I reached the room, the keycard wouldn't work, so I had to go back to the reception and report the issue, which took another 10 minutes to hand me the right key card 3. Even though the room had been ""freshened up"", there was a strong tobacco smell. 4. Though not a big issue for me, the room doesn't have a bathtub. 5. WORST of all, I had to check out at at 7am due to a meeting and when I stepped into a shower at 6am, lo and behold, there was no water! I called the reception to check and was told that due to"
2779,"Last August I waxed about the JW as a ""Memorable Experience"" and received lots of e mails, most supportive some questioning various elements. I still stand by that rating but noted with this most recent visit a couple of areas that need review.  First the positives. Executive staff spot on. Ami who is the EA to the GM still working her magic even when on vacation. The Front Office under Vikram Kakroo excellent and he made it a point to meet me a couple of times. Staff upfront greeting and security wonderful, efficient while doing their job. Transportation to and from, yes not inexpensive, but worth the hassle avoidance. Of course what makes this a stand-out is the location in Juhu. I saw this hotel being constructed and stayed thru the early years, the year Mumbai was attacked"
2780,"I'm not a big fan of resorts in places like Goa and Marrakesh... the ones that make you forget the city you are in offer an all-encompassing experience that's so good, you don't need to go out to explore the actual destination at all. JW Marriott, for me, is one such getaway haven in Mumbai  Currently running on just 50 per cent of its full strength, with the right side of the hotel under renovation, the JW is busy as hell. Room sizes are small in its class, but the new design that opens up the bath area has made them seem bigger. I personally don't like the fact that one has to walk through the WC area to get to the shower.  Every room has a view of the sea thanks to the diagonal protrusion, but try to get a pool facing room to get a double view: of the pool and the sea.  The"
2781,"I think I will consider jw as my favourite hotel I have visited in life , the location , service, hospitality is the best I have seen. when visit Mumbai don't ever miss to go to Mezzo Mezzo (an Italian cusuine), Italian food is taken very seriously here and the restaurant brings its chefs all the way from different regions of Italy."
2782,"Although the JW Marriott has recently been refurbished (one wing still closed for refurbishment) there is little that can be done to compensate for the poor original architecture. The rooms have low ceilings, and the windows are placed at a diagonal, so that most rooms get a sea-facing view - as result you get dark rooms, and when you decide to enjoy the view you first have to look beyond the pile of pigeon droppings on the fake balconies. We stayed in an executive room for 4 nights, which is the highest category before suites, and the room was quite small and felt cramped. The bathroom in particular involved navigating two sets of doors that clashed with each other opening in opposing directions.  On the redeeming side, the bed and pillows were very comfortable, room service"
2783,"Firstly the stuff were very unfriendly. I was treated more like an intruder. Everytime that i entered and left the hotel i was asked if i am staying at the hotel and my room number. Everytime i was very rudely approached by a guy asking me this. I did not feel like a guest at all in this hotel. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and when you are paying top dollar to stay in a 5 star hotel, one would not even imagine been treated like that but sadly that is how that hotel operates. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. There are much much better hotels to stay at with obviously better service. Very Dissapointed!"
2784,"Caveat Emptor - I did not stay here as they were sold out, but I had lunch, drinks and dinner with my wife all in the same day in this fantastic establishment.   I stayed on the other side of town at the Taj, but the JW has a special place in our hearts as after our first meeting here and all we ever stay at are the JW group of hotels and they rarely disappoint.  The buffet is extensive but well worth it. Try not going during peak hours.  If you are from India, you will spot celebrities here all the time. I remember when I told my wife, did Rishi Kapoor just take our spot?? what the heck! :)   Go here folks. You will not be disappointed."
2785,"I have stayed here twice. I know, why twice given the rating? We had a very late flight coming in and I was with colleagues, and some were used to the western standards. I thought I would give it another shot.   Turnes out I shouldn't have. Food also very expensive, buffet style. Nice lobby but that's about it. Even the garden area looked tired, and the whole pool experience wasn't classy to say the least.  Rooms are mix of upscale/old school/tired. Haven't ventured too far outside but what I have seen wasn't anything worth going out of one's way for.  My picks, next time would be by far trendy Bandra (Try Taj Land's End is just perfect!). I can also recommend Taj Palace in Colaba.  Don't stay here. I'm sure lots of better options even in the neighbourhood."
2786,"I stayed at the JW Marriott Mumbai from 17th - 22nd December. I travelled alone due to some last minute changes to my husband's plans and I was rather apprehensive. It was also due to initial frustration with the reservations department. I found that I got different information about rates and room classifications from different people I spoke to, which irritated me as one seemed to know their stuff and didnt really inspire much confidence.   However, the staff at the hotel totally changed my mind and made me stay such a memorable one from the get-go.  Upon arrival, I was delayed for two whole hours by the airport staff due to inefficiency. By the time I got out of the airport, it was close to 1am. I was hot, tired, overwhelmed and I literally had steam coming out of my ears."
2787,If i find a good deal i always book in this amazing hotel perfectly located on the beach.. The rooms are spatious and overlooking the ocean. The service and breakfast are perfect.. There is also a very nice Spa to relax after the overcrowded mumbai.. One of the best hotel in mumbai..
2788,"Great location next to the beach...I could soak up the unending waves in the morning and was really fresh.  Loved it.  The room was very well stuffed, one of the very few hotels I can say has got good lighting and also was calm at night.  Food was excellent and so was the service...thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  And will definitely return"
2789,"I stayed at the Marriott in Mumbai a couple of times with my wife on weekends and found the place to be quite relaxing. While many complain that the age of the Marriott has started showing on this property, I do have reasons to believe that's true. There is rarely anything new on the menu at The Lotus Cafe & Saffron. We have visited this place so many times that we now feel its not worth trying it out again. However if you wish to just go there and take a walk around their beautiful pool area and try the spa - this can be a refreshing break within the crazy city life. Rooms have been recently done up and are beautifully maintained - the last time we stayed we got a room facing the sea on the top floor and was worth every moment of the price. The bathroom amenities are also"
2790,"We stayed at three Marriott properties in our three-city India tour in November.  We had high expectations for this hotel, but were disappointed.  On check-in, as a Platinum member, I was first given substandard rooms (I had three rooms reserved).  Only after having the manager intercede did the front desk clerk assign proper rooms.  The hotel is undergoing some renovation, and thus the Concierge lounge was closed and we were told to go to the bar instead.  The front desk clerk initially also said that only the ""one room assigned to the Platinum member"" is available for Concierge bar use, but again, the manager changed this once I mentioned that I'd never experienced that at any Marriott or Hilton properties worldwide.  Maybe it's a training issue with the front desk, but they"
2791,"As part of our 36th Wedding anniversary, we were staying in parts of Mumbai, this being a 3-night stay. On arrival at 3pm when our suite and one double room should have been ready, we were kept waiting nearly an hour as they had messed up our booking. We were offered one room and were told to wait till midnight when we could have the other room. Then the general manager came up to our room and tried to kick us out as he had double-booked! They ruined our special day! Beware of the extensive building works going on. The whole hotel is covered in a fine mist of dust. I had informed them that I suffer from asthma and they should have mentioned the works. However, they are greedy and do not care about their guests. The executive lounge was a disgrace with sandwiches left uncovered"
2792,We stayed at the Marriott Mumbai for 2 nights in December 2012. This was our 2nd visit to this hotel. Overall the hotel is an excellent choice although it is slightly more expensive than other 5 star hotels in Mumbai. The bedroom was clean and comfortable with a good shower. The breakfast was excellent and the choice of restaurants in the hotel is very good.
2793,"Frequent overnight stay, great service staff, excellent food, the brunch is excellent. Rooms have been upgraded so you feel a difference. Business Center staff go an extra mile to help you. Overall a great experience. thanks and keep it up!"
2794,"This hotel is well-located with nice and roomy renovated rooms and unparalleled service. The lobby, pool and restaurants are sumptuous. Rooms are well-equipped and beds comfortable. No sound issues. Breakfast is a treat - over 150 dishes, several made to order. Service is the best I've found anywhere in the world. Would recommend requesting a pool-facing room for unobstructed beach views. Only quibble would be quality of room service food. Menu has good amount of variety but actual food is sub-par for what one would expect of 5 star hotel. The chicken pieces in curries, for example, are obviously just boiled and thrown in - which leaves it with that distinctive taste that I personally find difficult to swallow. Nachos a disaster! (no cheese!!) I would knock half a point off for"
2795,"Our family stayed there for 2 weeks last december (2011)and had an excellent time. Excellent service, and excellent breakfast. The Lobby is very well designed and the ambience is awesome. My kids enjoyed the easy access to the beach and the location is perfect.  Gym is OK - better than some other hotels but definitely not a Lifetime Fitness quality) Surprisingly the beach is clean (by local standards!) The new rooms are great (although small) but with all the amenities. There is always a lot of buzz here and many activities going on - if you enjoy those kind of things.. My kids spotted a couple of Bollywood actors which was quite thrilling for them. Some very good restaurants nearby that will deliver (e.g Gajalee if you like seafood).  I am a Marriott Platinum so had access to"
2796,Stayed for 3 nights on a business trip.  Pros : - nice seaview - excellent restaurants - vibrant lobby with live music playing the morning and evenings - superb gym and healthclub  Cons - Small rooms - Weird room design. to go to the bath you have to go through the toilet - on all 3 days I had to ask for my choice of newspapers. Normally a good 5 star hotel would pick up the request on the first day itself! Was amazed at this lack of attention to detail!
2797,Stayed at the hotel for three nights on a business trip. They didn't have a smoking room so I got upgraded to a suite! Big rooms very elegant. Lovely sea veiw thru the big windows. Water in the pool was a bit too cold. Good service everyone was very helpful and polite. The hotel is right on the beach. The beach like all of Mumbai was always full of people. Felt spooky going to the beach thru the big wooden gate-like door. Only two things that I didn't like. The smell in the lobby was awful at times ( I think it was comming from the sea) and there wasn't much to do in the hotel in terms of activities. Overall you will like it saying there.
2798,"An amazing hotel, as you'd expect.  Right on Juhu beach with direct access.  As with all hotels like this in India the food and drink prices are elevated but you expect that.  The pool is amazing and hotel and it's staff meet the 5* rating."
2799,"My wife and I spent a lovely week here in September. The hospitality was first class and the rooms were excellent. The only issue we had was the food, which while good fell slightly short of five star.  Nevertheless, highly recommended."
2800,"I stayed at JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai with my family. The hotel entrance and lobby are amazing. The rooms were lovely, clean and spacy. The pool area was looking fantastic. The service was good and quick. We really had a very good time and enjoyed a lot."
2801,"Both the entrance to the hotel and the lobby are breathtaking. The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. The pool area looks onto the beach and looks fantastic, there were just enough sunbeds though I imagine at times, there will be a shortage.  As this is a Marriott everything is extra, so follow these tips..  1. Do not use there in house taxi service, 2400 RS versus 500 RS for a Taxi to the nearby airport, the door staff will get you a cab from the street if you ask (tip them), also when arriving in Mumbai, get the prepaid taxi from the airport.  2. The internet is expensive, join Marriott rewards programme it;s free and and you get complimentary wireless internet access.  3. Ensure you settle your bill in Indian Rupees to get a better exchange rate from your card provider,"
2802,"I have stayed at this hotel for 16 nights straight in my first trip to India and I have to say I was pleased with my choice. The hotel lobby is the life of Mumbai: you sit in the lobby in one of the couches on a Friday night and you can entertain yourself people watching, while sipping nice drinks from the bar. The restaurant choices are great, even if you don‚Äôt like Indian food (like me) . The rooms are well appointed, bottle water, shoeshine and suit press complimentary every night. The grounds are exceptional, magnificent pool and great beach. The negative is that, probably due to security, the pool and grounds are separated from the beach with a massive wall, and the only beach access is through a tiny door, where you need to ring a bell (an actual bell!). I would not"
2803,"My first stay in this hotel in Mumbai and I'd go back for more.  The room was large and comfortable, clean and pleasent with a veiw over the beach. The pool is not so plagued by insects, perhaps due to the sea air and has plenty of seats and a good bar and food service. The food is great with plenty of choice. Although the Italian was closed (shame) - but more than made up for by the all you can eat Indian dishes, supported by a very good wine list. A good spa with lots of services on offer. The staff were great - thanks Pansoon and Tripod!  Another review by rolf the reviwer 200121117"
2804,"This hotel was not only gorgeous but the staff was fabulous.  If you need a hotel driver, be sure to ask for Nagesh.  He was awesome.  He really took care of me -- especially when I was alone.  Beautiful view from the hotel room.  Great restaurants inside -- including the hotel breakfast.  I also felt very secure."
2805,"I usually wait a week before writing a review, but am still in this hotel as I write this review! It's a beautiful property, and the rooms are in great condition.The staff is helpful, and goes an extra mile. The pool is a delight to use, and offers a stunning view - my husband has been using the personal trainer, and has loved the experience! So far, so good...  But the business centre at this hotel has been an absolute disappointment. The staff at the business centre is completely different in its attitude and pro-activeness when compared to the staff in the rest of the hotel. Simple requests aren't managed well - for e.g. can we get filter coffee instead of instant coffee. Things are painfully slow. Took them ten minutes to organise four clean plates (they hadn't set aside the"
2806,"This is a gorgeous hotel with tight security, top-notch service, and a stellar breakfast buffet. The pools are really wonderful as well. The grounds are really well manicured. All rooms face the ocean and are extremely comfortable. The staff is really accommodating as well. India is tough, sometimes. There are some hard things to see, and you can easily get yourself into a tight spot if you don't know what you're doing. The people who work here are really conscious of that- and if this is a first or last stop for you in India, I highly recommend hiring a driver to take you around for a day- shopping, sight-seeing, whatever. The cost is minimal and the drivers are a wealth of knowledge preparing you to go out on your own.   Walking through the lobby and overlooking the cafe below"
2807,"When selecting a hotel in Mumbai, be cautious of the location. Mumbai is so diverse and full of contrast, there are slums amongst some of the finest 5-star hotels. The JW Marriott Mumbai is very private and highly secure. In fact, the security routine before one enters the hotel is comparable to checking in at an airport. Once I got over the intensity of the security checks at the entrance, I proceeded to the check-in counter, where the staff are quite formal and neutral in emotion but were helpful in facilitating a change in the room type booked. The hotel lobby is impressive and has retail stores which can easily distract you whilst making your way to your room. The room itself was lovely, very luxurious & tastefully decorated. I have stayed at this hotel twice already, and"
2808,"This must be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. My wife and I visited India for the first time and could not have been more impressed by the high level of service. Many members of staff travelled that extra mile to ensure we had the best time.  From the Bar Mn ( who resembled Manny from Modern Family!) to the breakfast waiter who made Late in a different bar as we mentioned it tasted nicer than the breakfast machine   Only let down was the massive refurbishment program they are undergoing which was not fully explained when we booked and the noise is bit unfortunate   It is paradise amongst the noise, mess and dirt of one of India's major cities"
2809,"The JW Marriott is a 5 star luxury hotel that overlooks Juhu Beach and the Arabian Sea. The hotel is open and spacious. The rooms are fairly small, but okay - some seafacing.   The food in any one of the several restaurants is pretty good - including the extremely popular (reservations required) Sunday brunch at the Lotus Cafe.   Enigma is the very popular nightclub where you can spot Bollywood celebrities partying with Marriott guests and young Mumbaikers well past Mumbai's curfew.   The pool area is nice but the spa is just okay - massages not the best. The best thing about the hotel is the Bombay Baking Company where you can get sandwiches, pastries, cappuccinos, etc. And if you need a special occasion cake, this is the place!!  Although Mumbai hotel prices are very high, I"
2810,it was a good experience to stay in this hotel for a night... the locality is unmatched.... thats JUHU and one of the busiest places also along with one of the most happening.... there is Prithvi theater close to the hotel so you can watch plays.... also there is a cinema hall where u can watch movies... PVR JUHU.... apart frm these two there are a lot of night clubs and pubs in the area.... the hotel itself has a night club but to be true there are better ones around the area.... the food in the hotel is nice but there are better places around to explore....the hotel is at a very good property.... its beach facing....the customer service is not upto the mark but one can do with that... the rooms are excellent up to the mark....all in all if u have the money to splurge on a
2811,We spent one night here after a disappointing stay at Vivanta Fort Aguada by Taj.  I can not find any fault with JW Marriott.  Check in was very straight forward and staff couldn't be more helpful.  Booked three rooms and they arranged for them to be close together. Advice on what to see and do in Mumbai.  Ganesh the reception manager personally introduced himself.  We were escorted to the rooms.  One room smelt of smoke and was immediately changed to another room without even having to ask.  The rooms were of a high standard.  Wifi is not included for free - but if you sign up to the Marriott rewards scheme (free) it is included.  The bar Arola was out of this world.  Best gin and tonic I have ever had.  I can see why it was frequented by the likes of Karan Johar who was
2812,"I recently visited India and stayed with my family for 1 night at this hotel in Oct 2012. The hotel is beautiful and is truly an oasis in the middle of bustling Mumbai. But I had a terrible billing and post-check-out nightmare.  I had provided a credit card upfront for pre-authorization. At checkout, I settled all charges on a different debit card. However, the hotel forgot to release the charges on the credit card I provided upfront. It was a total of around US $800 (INR 46,000). After returning to the US a couple of weeks later, I got a rude shock when I saw my credit card statement. I immediately called the hotel and lodged a complaint. I was assured that it would be taken care of the next morning. I called the next evening and was told the same. Three weeks and umpteen phone"
2813,"As a first time visitor to both India and Mumbai, I opted to stay with my favorite hotel chain. The Bad first: My room was the smallest JW Marriott room that I have experienced anywhere in the world. I was told that I had a view of the ocean, but only if I stood on the couch sitting in front of the window at the corner of my room. Now, I am quick to add that most of the Executive floor including the lounge is closed for remodeling. However, as a Top Tier Rewards member, I was provided with breakfast, afternoon tea and evening beverages in the lobby and lower lobby areas of the hotel. Another important point is the location of this hotel. While close to the airports (30 Minutes), if you have business in South Mumbai, you may want to rethink staying at this property due to"
2814,"A 5 star hotel on Juhu Beach facing the beach a great experience to stay in this hotel if you have work near Juhu area or in suburbs. Dont stay in this hotel if you have work in town side or south mumbai as you will spend lot of time in traveling. The hotel is on a traffic zone.   This Hotel is one among the best on the beach sides of Mumbai Huge rooms, perfect staff, Great environmental pleasures, Perfect romantic blend, this hotel the service is bit slow but food is good. Try it out"
2815,"I have stayed repeatedly at the JW Marriott over the last few years, and enjoy the service and ambiance of this hotel. The views out onto the beach and the ocean are great, and the wonderful breakfast buffet in the downstairs lobby restaurant has lovely views onto the gardens and swimming pool area. They have now started to renovate the interior, which is about time, as some parts of the hotel start feeling dated. At this visit (October 2012), half of the hotel rooms were closed for renovation, as well as the Executive Lounge area. I stayed in one of the renovated rooms, which are functional and business-like, but seem to have become smaller. It was a premium room with ocean-view, which you had to crane your neck for. The new layout has the sink area integrated in the room, and"
2816,"I have bit the bullet and booked this hotel for an 11 night stay with a friend for January 2013. Am a little nervous as we tend to go to India often and the star status never usually fits the standards I expect, the reviews have helped me make my decision. So watch this space ...."
2817,"Checked in on oct 8. Tight security as usual on entry into compound. Checkin was done in the room, and was friendly and efficient. Had a view of the ocean, clean and comfortable. Restaurant at the lower level served a good buffet spread for lunch and breakfast. Service was excellent and very attentive. Hotel has a nice pool facing the ocean but did not use it.  Overall an excellent hotel well supported by its excellent and professional people."
2818,"Fantastic expereience.  Rooms were amzing.  Club downstairs was great.  The doorman remembers you, even if you dont see him for a while.  Pool is clean and perfect.  Executive conceirge service was fantastic (recommended if you have the access)."
2819,"We checked in and they gave us a 20 minute speech about how they were upgrading us to an ocean view and club floor and giving us ALL these benefits because of my husband's Marriott Rewards status.  As we walked away from the desk I asked that the CONFIRMED extra bed be delivered at 7pm, and the reception person looked shocked and said 'no extra bed will fit in that room, maybe we can put mattress the floor?'    I said that was not acceptable - then they determined it would work and showed us to a TINY room, where if you stood RIGHT NEXT TO the window and looked right you could see the beach, from everywhere else in the room you only saw grey concrete blocks of hotel windows.  Then the air conditioning didn't work... so they moved us to larger room, no ""ocean view"".  Fine.  Then"
2820,"Stayed in the JW in February 2012, opted for a standard room.   Overall a very nice stay in Mumbai, the hotel is well guarded, reception staff very well trained and extremely helpful. All staff members throughout the complex are willing to help, always saying hello and smiling.  Room was very comfortable facing towards the beach. No complaints except for the internet, very slow and really in this day and age why charge? I know of 3* hotels that don't charge for internet!!  Otherwise good, reliable clean room service 24/7!  Overall a great sight to see after a very hectic and long day on the streets of mumbai!  Well done JW!"
2821,"After my last poor review regarding this hotel, my review was brought to the attention of Vineet Mishra Director of Operations for Marriott who came to meet me at check in on my return stay after Chennai at check in.      He was most apologetic regarding my previous stay and provided me with a upgrade suite that surpassed my expectations in everyway ‚Äì it seems it does pay to review in Trip Advisor  as it does get noticed and it was very refreshing that when my review and complaint was brought to the Management team at Marriot they acted on it and then some in the most professional manner.      My experience on the return journey was more than satisfactory and the Management team went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience on my return by providing me with a fully"
2822,"I have recently visited JW Marriott Hotel mumbai coffee shop ""Lotus Cafe "" great vegetarian traditional food and top class services , I have ever received at all the hotels I have been to Mr.Vijay who was managing the restaurant added extra touch to the experience"
2823,"I have no reference of other hotels in Mumbai, however I do of others in India.  Located on the Beach, large pools and outdoor lounge areas, night club in the basement on weekends is a blast. Bar upstairs hosts page 5 celebrity events which are fun to crash - tha paparazzi lines are fun to walk through as well...  Food is good, stayed there for 6 nights earlier this year with no Deli-Belly!  Staff are everywhere. Security is very high, all the X-ray, car searches, metal detectors you should expect from a hotel in the city looking after your well being.  The room i was in was newly updated. They do need to work on the humidity level in the hall ways and common area. Nice gym. Plenty of secure, clean outdoor grounds to keep kids busy if necessary."
2824,"I believe this is one of the best hotels that India has to offer. Amazing rooms , great service and of course very very good staff. The spa is sensational. I will be looking forward to visit with my family coz coming here for just business is a crime."
2825,"This beautiful beautiful hotel is located right next to one of the most famous beaches in Mumbai, the Juhu Beach.   During my business trip, I stayed in a kingsize bedroom with beach and ocean view. There was also airconditioning and a very luxury bathroom.   Really good choice of restaurants. There was everything, Spanish, International, Italian, Indian and Asian. Personally I recommend the ""Mezzo Mezzo"" which is the Italian restaurant in the hotel.  All in all, it was definitely a very nice business stay for me."
2826,"It was hot and Mumbai was crowded, the taxi wait at the airport was long, road were congested and full of hooting, but once we stepped foot in the hotel, it was the start of heaven!! Marriotts are known to be a good chain of hotels in the world, but this one was just amazing.  A small problem that was brought to the attention of the manager was swiftly taken care of ..what a service. Breakfast and the staff serving there remains one of the best we have experienced so far."
2827,i stayed in this fabulous hotel for three nights this month -- beleive me its worth the price - great ambience and still greater staff - thanx to Pascole my registration was a breeze - the rooms are great and if you can get the ocean facing one like i had it is awsome -- only small problem i faced was in the late delivery of the room service - otherwise its the best place to stay in mumbai !!!  love to go back for the breakfast - its quite a spread and on two days i had to skip lunch as i had so heavy breakfast
2828,This Hotel is the best hotel in mumbai with the beach on the back of the hotel. They have new rooms on the fifth floor with beautiful Italian Marble and bathrooms. All rooms face the sea and the food is awasome.
2829,"On your first visit, the Lobby and almost never ending expanse of the garden, pool and the sea will surely bowl you over.  The restaurants, coffee shops are awesome. Special mention of the bakery! they stock the nicest and most sinful stuff.  View from the buffet breakfast area is simply fabulous and a nice buffet breakfast here is bound to make your day.  There can't be two ways about how happening this place is and has always been! The who's who of Bollywood & the most powerful can be spotted at JWM.  BUT...  The rooms came in for disappointment... They are small and outdated. Toiletries offered were also pathetic and did not give you the feel of pamper..expected at a hotel of this category.  A ""trip charge"" to the room, I think is ridiculous. Consider You call for an ice"
2830,I booked myself for one night at the JW Marriott Mumbai. I am thankful for the upgrade they provided to a premier room. The room was large and tastefully done up stocked with many supplies and amenities.  However found the warmth missing for some reason. I found the lobby and coffeeshop to be a thorough fare with people walking in and out in numbers. This gave the hotel an image of being abuzz with non residents and not really as upmarket.  Swimming in the pool was a major disappointment as pool water was stinking of creek/fish smell of the sea. Pool would also get quite crowded with non resident guests and members. I also found it awkward that one had to go to the swimming pool dripping wet with robes through the coffeeshop (lotus). At breakfast buffet found a lady chef to be
2831,"After getting through the thorough security prior to entering the facility, I was greeted by a staff that could not have done more to make me feel comfortable in this foreign country and city that is more than an eye opening experience for any ex-pat.  All of the restaurants were excellent and boasts chefs from around the world.  The business center is well equipped to handle all situations and even provided conference rooms for no charge when needed.  The spa looked very nice, though I did not have the time to use it.  The pool facilities were well maintained and should be used whenever it is not raining during the monsoon season.  Venturing out from the grounds of the JW Marriott is quite an experience.  There is no need to go far, but a short walking tour to the north"
2832,"If you stay here anytime in the next year, your day will be filled with  JACKHAMMERS, noise and BANGing reverberating throughout the walls and framework.  2/3 of the hotel is under construction and there is no escaping the constant noise.  They don't quit at 5PM either.  Beware.    They should just close down the hotel and do this work, but they want you to subsidize their reconstruction with your money and tolerance."
2833,"My wife and I now always stay at the JW Marriott when in Mumbai. Excellent location on Juhu Beach, beautifully designed Hotel with excellent restaurants and facilities. The Front desk staff are wonderful and if you treat them with respect (NRIs pay attention this is especially for you) and don't yell at them, you will experience great service and an upgrade if you are deserving. The concierge level club is amazing! Impeccable service, great food and very polite and caring staff. If you need help and Vikram Kakroo can't help, try Ami who I hope is still EA to the GM and should be a manager herself. Convenient location to shopping and the airport and a very safe location to stay when in Mumbai. Oh did I mention a great location for Bolywood stars! Kudos to all of the staff. We"
2834,"In august 2012 i stayed for 7 nights at the Marriott juhu in Mumbai. First the positives - it is in the nice location at the juhu beach and  near to everything including airport (30 min drive avg) - the hotel infrastructure is huge including the lobby and there are many restaurants - the shower is fantastic with big shower head and sufficient space for even couples  However there are few suggestions of improvemenet - I found too many staff but they are really not giving good service and have not been trained properly. Difficulty in checking with a guest relation, difficulty in even getting things done at business centre (may be they were all interested in Saudi Aramco recruitment!). I would rather have few staff who knows what todo than an army of other staff - the duvet is"
2835,"JW Marriott Hotel, at Juhu, Mumbai is an excellently located property, and has a great view of the Arabian Sea.   I am a regular guest there---but during my last visit on July 30, the occupancy apparently was quite low, but yet, the service standards appeared to have declined significantly.  This was quite obvious at the 24-hour coffee shop at the breakfast--- they hand over the previous day's newspaper---the covers are not properly laid--they serve the wrong tea--- rather poorly done parathas at the spot-cooking table--- and so on.    I earnestly hope they had an off-day with the Trainee bearers---and that they would restore good standards soon !"
2836,"I have stayed at this shotel when on Business on several occassions. It is very large and spacious. Coffee shops, restaurants, business centre, swimming pool, several bars etc. This hotel is not cheap and they have never said they were.  Location is great for relaxing after a long day doing business.  I usually take a swim, a walk along the beach and then a few naughty beers before adventuring out for dinner.  Staff are very polite and attentive. Breakfast like the other reviewers have mentioned is really great. Love the early morning background of the piano being played.  Rooms on the Exec floors are great. Clean and comfortable. Love the cookies that are made in house.  Some tips that I hope will help: This hotel is used by some of India's most affluent and people in show"
2837,"There is no better place then the Marriott Mumbai, Beautiful sandstone hotel with large rooms and great service at your beck and call one step out the front into the pool court yard and gardens makes you forget your in one of the largest metropolis cities in the world.   Venue has excellent security and facilities and if you stay to long you will start to think your one of the great maharaja's of the past :)"
2838,"Good business hotel, but showing a little wear and tear around the edges.  i normally stay at the Taj Lands End in Mumbai, and this is the first time I had stayed at JW Marriott.  Overall experience was fine, but the Taj is ""shinier"" and better quality.  The external structure at the JW Marriott is looking quite aged.  Staff were all very attentive - no complaints there.  There is quite a bit of renovating going on at the hotel at the moment in the building in terms of painting and updating."
2839,"I did not stay at the JW Marriott but spent 2 days there for a business seminar, and in the breaks I got the chance to have a good look around this famous Hotel.  Very impressive lobby and general areas.  The view from the main lobby through to back of hotel is spectacular, with a huge pool complex / grassy area and the sea waves rolling in directly it.  This looks like a great venue to host business strategy meeting for a few days, mixing work and relaxation outside by the pool.  The meeting room facilities were first class, among the best I have experienced.  The setup of all AV and PA was spot on, and the food / coffee quality at breaks and lunch was really very good.  Hotel staff seemed attentive and helpful.  All in all, it was a pleasure to attend my business seminar for 2"
2840,"I Regularly Visit Here,Its One Of My Favs,Beautiful With Fabb!! Ambeince..Pool Side & Lobbies R Awesome,Bakery Shop & Jwellery Store R Also Very Nice,Excellent Treat For 'Family' 'Friends' 'Couples' & 'Parties'"
2841,Very huge coffee shop with extensively laid buffet. The Italian spread is awesom with all different types of pastas and pizzas which the kids loved...The live counter was good as it not only made pastas in front of us but also grilled vegetables and fish in front of us.The grilled chicken ofcourse was very tempting.All in all fantastic hotel with a huge poolside.
2842,"Nice hotel, good restaurants but food was just above average. Pricey due to location, may not appear to be value for the money being paid. Rooms are cosy."
2843,"It was very good experience to stay at jw marriott Mumbai. Services were nice, staff was gentle.  Hotel location is excellent near sea. And such place in in area like Juhu is best to stay for. And those who love Bollywood celebraties, shall sure come and stay in this Hotel. Aha experience."
2844,this hotel is an absolute must if you are staying in mumbai. it takes you away from all that traffic and congestion and is unbelievably relaxing. feels like you are not even in mumbai. amazing!!! Also the buffet breakfast is a must. you will not regret it.
2845,Stayed there on a business trip. The room was smelling like a damp towel ! The service was even worse. Never staying there again... The location is good because it overlooks the ocean :) but I suggest you find another hotel !
2846,Gave a very cozy and homely feeling. It made me comfortable when when i was alone travelling. You feel safe and get all comforts possible. All Staff was very supportive. Front desk staff was supportive in aaddressing your room requests etc.
2847,"I had stayed at the JW Marriott for a weekend while in Mumbai for a wedding and it was a great hotel to stay at with good service. The proximity to the beach as well as the night spots and restaurants makes it a great place to stay. It is also a place that attracts a lot of the Mumbai glitterati, so you might just end up catching a glimpse of your favorite Bollywood actor/actress.   The only downside is that it is extremely pricey. The basic room put me back $300 a night which seems quite a bit for India. If you are interested in enjoying luxury which is in proximity to a good night life, this would be a great hotel."
2848,Excellent hotel .... sea view .... best place to stay ...  its near by airport so obviously convient stay ... if you disco lover i bet you people like Enigma disco pub .....excellent condition of room which is clean ... nice swimming pool inside hotel ...
2849,"We stayed there for our annual Xmas/New Year trip to Mumbai and Goa and as per usual it didn't disappoint.  Excellent location, always clean, tidy an presentable and above all really helpful staff.  Only downside is sometimes the staff expect tips where I don't agree they should be given one and some of the senior staff can come across arrogant but overall it's a brilliant hotel with a great pool (spent most of our time there) and great Sunday brunch."
2850,"Be it business or pleasure I have stayed here so many times.. the JW Mumbai is one hotel where you can afford to mix business with pleasure..  Situated in an excellent place in Juhi, its beautiful to watch the sunset through your balcony. Most rooms of this hotel is sea facing & pool facing & after using the conferencing facilities its a bliss to enjoy the sun set.  Being situated is the heart of Mumbai night life rocks here & the very own enigma beats through the night.  The hotel staff are good but at times can be candid..! All in all a fantastic hotel"
2851,"On my way to the Mumbai Airport, my host wanted me to enjoy breakfast at the Marriott Hotel... Although we were almost too late although we were not staying guests, hotel staff still let us enjoy their buffet... It was absolutely the best. Although we were the last ones eating, we were not rushed, we were even offered that we could walk around the outdoor pools and to the beach area. Other hotels were not as friendly as the staff at the Marriott."
2852,"Had two stays here, one for a night in June, and one for 2 nights in May. Both were absolutely fantastic. Booked two different packages for the two stays to try things out. My first stay was a package that included airport transfers and breakfast. Everything was perfect from the get go. There was a rep waiting at the airport with a BMW 7 series. Transfer was quick and very comfortable. Chilled bottled water was provided in the car which was very welcome since it was blazingly hot.  Check in was a breeze and very quick and I was escorted to my room. I was given a pool facing room with views of the pool and the beach. The rooms are smallish but comfortable. The decor is neutral but tastefully done. Some fruits were provided as a welcome amenity. The bathroom is all marble and"
2853,Just one nite stay hotel in excellent condition rooms very clean good  cont brakfast easy check in and out would have liked to stay longer but no time but will be back guranteed.
2854,"This hotel is very well located on the beach with very pleasant views, especially from the pool area. The rooms were everything you would expect in a hotel of this quality and i felt relaxed immediately on entering the room. As stated by another contributor, breakfast in to die for, I warn you, you will have to be very self controlled not to eat too much!  I would definitely return here."
2855,"An excellent property on Juhu Tara Beach, where you can find your favorite Bollywood stars jogging by in the mornings.  The pool overlooks the sea and the view is to die for.  Beginning with the rooms, I was in the Executive Premier Room and it was amazing. Well Maintained with the Marriott Bed and lovely Bath amenities.  The executive lounge serves delicious food and remember to have the Masala Tea while there.  I had an excellent stay at this property and strongly recommend this to all of you.   Thus, summerising everything, Pros: Good Rooms and Bathrooms, Executive Lounge (and the view from there), a true Marriott experience.  Cons: It is a little far from tourist attractions and Marine Drive, but Mumbai's traffic is Mumbai's traffic!"
2856,"We visited Marriott mumbai recently, loved the breakfast buffet! I would like to mention Yummy cupcakes given to us by a very pretty chef, Grishma! Thank you so much! We usually visit Sahara Star for breakfast, i think its changed now, im sure to come back soon :)"
2857,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in!!  Cant ask for anything more. Great location, not far from the airport. Right on the beach. Excellent places to eat within the hotel. Staff are fantastic, very friendly and talkative.   Have to go through a security check every time you enter the hotel but it‚Äôs a minor issue. I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry.   Poolside has been amazing. Buffet breakfast was faultless. A vast array of fine cuisine from all over the world. Freshly cooked too. Something for everyone."
2858,this is one of the best hotels ever. the service and facilities are fantastic great for business or holiday . i go on business but will be starting my honeymoon there. the food is superb and should you wish to have something off menu there always deliver. i can say no more. fantastic. rooms have been upgraded in recent years and very modern. the suites are as you would expect top  !
2859,"Don't get me wrong, this is a damned good hotel - No question. However, it just lacks that final tipping point to get 5 in my opinion. Check-in very good and I was up-graded to a suite with a superb view over the sea. Room was superb, well it was a suite and it had everything you would want. Fittings were good and free Internet was very fast and easy to access. Now down stairs to meet colleague for a drink in 'Reflections' bar. Frankly, it's awful and looks like a temporary bar with two stools and three bar men who also temporary. Huge lobby and reception, absolutely teeny sparsely decorated and attended bar up a corner to the right. Finally, food: I sent my rack of lamb back because it was too-rare but that may have been me not explaining my requirements fully. The dish was"
2860,"Don't get me wrong, I love India, I love the people, the sound, the smells (well some of them), the total chaos, but it's nice to escape into the JS at the end of a day and just chill.  This was my second stay and it has been great both time.  I had access to the Business Loungue which serves good (free) food and drink and provides access to a computer and printer, handy for checking in for flights.  The rooms are brilliant or maybe I've been lucky both time.  I've had space, comfort, work and play zones and the large selection of free tv stations is great compared to many a hotel in Europe.  The staff can't do enough for you, the aiport pick up and drop off and god-send of air-conditioned bliss after / before a long flight.  The pool is great, the gym even better, the"
2861,"The location is just  wonderful with the view on Juhu Beach, and on the fantastic swimming pool. Half of the hotel has been redone completely, and the rooms are  lovely. The service is outstanding: this is really a five star hotel. The retaurants are plentiful: Japanese, Italian, Indian of course and very  soon Spanish. The food is great. Having stayed in other hotels in Bombay, the JJ Marriott is, for me the number one in this lively  city."
2862,"Great location, along Juhu Beach in a beautiful tropical garden with fantastic swimming pools, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, good restaurants and bars in the hotel itself. There is a very good choice of bars and restaurants with excellent food service to match their generally high prices.The rooms are being renovated at the moment. Very impressive entrance hall and staff everywhere to assis."
2863,"I recently got back from 10 days in Mumbai staying at this resort.  AMAZING!  I don't even know where to begin!  We stayed in a seaview executive suite.  The room had amazing views from every window.  It was so spacious as well.  The bathroom was huge and while having a shower you look out over the pool and beach.  The room was cleaned every day and was immaculate.  The best breakfast buffet I have every experienced.  Soooo much to choose from, western, Indian, American anything you can think of.  10 days and I didn't get sick of anything as there was so much choice.  We tried all the restaurants at the hotel and every one of them was as good as the other.    Every single person in the hotel greets you and is so pleasant.  I can not express how good the service was.  They just"
2864,"All in one word is Marvellous ..... Simply amazing hotel , best location , best restaurants , Amazing coffee coffee shop with Very professional Staff starting from Main gate to reception to Restaurant .."
2865,I have visited the JW Marriott in Mumbai with the family last weekend  and have had a wonderful experience . We were allotted a newly renovated  sea view suite which was very spacious and luxurious! The best experience was at the coffee shop during breakfast time . The staff remember your orders !The breakfast buffet is probably the best in Mumbai.  Great location and one can walk down onto the beach from the hotel  Highly recommended for travelers on business or pleasure .
2866,"The best your money can get you. Simply Luxurious in all terms. The only disadvantage - No in-house bar or discotheque was operational when I visited. After a day of hard-work, in-house bar/pub can be great refresher."
2867,"Wonderful hotel, beautiful and luxurious. I've been fortunate enough to stay here twice and have minimal complaints. It is like a palace on first entry and really nothing short of breathtaking. The restaurants are lovely, and I would highly recommend one takes a room on the executive (4th) floor where there is inclusive access to the executive lounge, where the friendly staff are happy to accommodate all your needs, and provide a lovely selection of food at every mealtime.   The Spices restaurant is second to none and I would recommend a trip there during your stay.   The only problem I personally encountered in the 2 stays I have been there, was I called for the hotel doctor on one occassion, and they did not come to the room as promised. We had to alternatively, use a local"
2868,"I travel for a solid 24 hours to arrive in Mumbai and the JW is the only place I would chose to stay.  Their exceptional customer service begins days before your arrival, I do not know if this is becuase I am a Marriott Gold Member or because I was returning for my 5th stay, but they sent me a personal preference form to complete, giving me an additional opportunity to add to any preferences I might have had in my reservation.  As a business traveler it is the little things that make a large diffence,such as specifying my reading preferences, favorite drinks or foods, and they met every single request I specified.  THe service began at the airport where they provided a personal car for transfer to the hotel. I emphasize this because late at night after a long flight you don't"
2869,"Stayed here just of a day, but really enjoyed the superb service and smiling faces at the hotel. They stand up to their star rating & justify the hefty charges :) The only negative point will be, if you are a tourist & would like to visit the hot tourist spots like Gateway, it will take atleast 1.5 - 2.0 oneway. Otherwise, the location is very good.."
2870,"The service was certainly number 1! The hotel is located in a nice part of the city. But is very far from south Mumbai where many of the tourist areas are located. The trafic, as is everywhere in India, is horrendious. The trip can take as long as 2hrs. to get to the Gate of India The rooms are large and very nicely equipted. The lobby is grand and once they get the pools renovated the view will be beautiful. I wish I had known about the renovations as this took much of the ambiance away along with the ability to relax in the sun. The hotel is located on the beach but to get to the beach you will need tto sign a log book and the attendent will unlock and unbolt 2 sets of doors to allow you to go to the beach. Scary!. When you wish to return, which was pretty quick in my case,"
2871,"Liked this hotel, luxury feel in public areas, restaurants and grounds,  pool just been refurb'd and lovely, nice jacuzzi in the pool, grounds nicely looked after, good pool side service.  Menu needs an update but good quality food.  Buffet good in main restaurant, Italian restaurant lovely, service outstanding in intalian, not so much in the main restaurant, rooms need a bit of updating, my room had a soaking wet carpet when I checked in which took days to dry out, they did immediately offer to move but the room had such a great sea view I stayed.  Would return, breakfast buffet incredible selection of food and really good quality. Direct beach access, sandy and nice views, Shops around all good to walk too and inc a ATM, pharmacy, off licence, taxi service, airport taxi approx"
2872,"The JW Marriott is located on Juhu Beach which is a lovely location in the northern part of Mumbai.  It is located about a 20 - 40 minute drive from the airport and a long way from what's considered to be downtown Mumbai (40 minutes at best, hours at worst).   Juhu Beach is a very affluent area of Mumbai where the rich (including Bollywood stars) live, eat, drink and play.  Some fantastic restaurants are within easy walking distance of the hotel.  The grounds of the hotel are outstanding, there are several pools (one of which is an infinity pool with a nicely placed waterfall), and very nice landscaping.  By the pool area there is a gate which you can use to access (and return from) the beach.    The rooms are very large and modernly equipped.      The breakfast choices are"
2873,"The hotel is situated in a busy posh locality in mumbai near a beach. The Juhu beach as it is called is a very crowded area specially on holidays and weekends. It is around 35-40 mins from the international airport on a busy traffic day. It is one of the very few hotels in india where the check-in time is 2.00 pm. The usual check-in time for hotels in India that i have seen is 12.00 pm. There was a queue for checking in as only two staff were present at the front office.The room that was given to me was at a good distance from the lift. There should be someone at the hotel who should be guiding the guests who are allocated these rooms at the end of floors.The room promised to me was a sea facing, but the window just gave you a glimpse of the sea. The restaurant is good but"
2874,"Located on Juhu Tara, the hotel is nicely situated on the ocean.  Grand in scale, the hotel, however, seems to need to be freshened up.  It just seems it's getting a little worn around the edges.  Pools were getting an overhaul when I was there.  Rooms are big & comfortable & the bathrooms are nice.  Overall, it's a nice hotel but nothing stellar to report here.  It's probably a 3.5 on the 5-point scale)."
2875,"I have been to the the Indian restaurant named, Saffron in J.W. Marriott, and trust me the food offerings are the best compared to the other restaurants in and around Mumbai. My personal favorite dish from the restaurant is Dal Makhani. In addition, the service staff is polite and helpful and keep you at ease while eating.  Its the best place in Mumbai to relax and enjoy with an amazing view of the Juhu Beach."
2876,"Having lived in Mumbai for 2 years I was a member of the JWM club which allowed me to use the pool and gym facilities and this I did quite happily, eating poolside with great service (menu was a bit repetitive after 2 years!) Anyhow this was a business trip for my husband and week of memories for me so chose the JWM for ease.  The rooms are a disappointment, old and tired but also rather small.  The bathroom was OK.  The walk from the bedroom to the reception was long and hot usually as aircon was not on very much in hallways and the key system to lifts failed regularly.  The room boys were good but hung around a tad too much expecting tips! The Italian restaurant was good for pizzas and fast service, the breakfast is vast and variable.  I understand the pool area is due a"
2877,"As a platinum, I was expecting to get a better view however all I got was a view of discarded mattresses, tables and chairs, what a disappointment. Also, the property is under renovation, so the fountain isnt working, without it there isnt much of a property grounds left.   Inspite of all this, I am still marking this hotel as a 'very good' simply because the service and the lounge are fantastic. The restaurant and spa were both very good. Its really a haven from the hustle bustle thats Mumbai, the pollution just as you step out of the hotel is enough to make you retreat back into this sanctuary.   In Indian standards its pretty expensive but when it comes to points, its really reasonable. I would recommend any of the Marriott Platinum/Gold members to take an opportunity to"
2878,"We stayed at the Marriott  Mumbai for 3 nights and it was just pure luxury. The service is fantastic - from the reception to pool staff they cannot do enough to help you.   The breakfast is just incredible - there's so much food it's impossible to pick what to have! It was all delicious and the service was amazing.  Our room was spacious, the bathroom was huge and it was all impeccably clean.   The whole hotel is a haven - we absolutely loved our stay here.   Make sure you go down to the beach for sunset - it's a great chance to see Mumbai life outside the Marriott's walls."
2879,"This is my second stay at this hotel - once for business and once for pleasure.  Both times it has been a fantastic experience - the staff in all areas of the hotel are fantastic, and go out of their way to be helpful.  So while there were some issues (such as the main pool being renovated), they went out of their way to provide alternatives.  The Executive Lounge has a great view of the beach and sunset, as well as great food.  The location is a fair way north of central Mumbai, but I personally like the local area, with a range of food and shopping options.  The missing piece are the rooms, only some of which have been renovated.  When this is finished, the hotel will be 5 stars again."
2880,I stayed there recently and was pleasantly surprised by the big lobby area and its vastness.  Good rooms but somewhat crampy/small.  Breakfast buffet was nice. Staff were always attentive and courteous.  Unfortunately the pool was under renovation.  The access to the beach from the poolside is excellent.  Porters/Doormen always expecting tips.  I guess its rampant all over India.
2881,"If you want superior rooms and superior service....then look no further! I took the Ocean Suite.....you have to see this room....enormous...2 rooms, and what a view of the beach!  Great food and superb service."
2882,"I stayed for one night and the room, service and environment was excellent. definately would stay again. unfortunately the pool area was under renovation."
2883,"Walking into the main hall of the JW Marriott reminded me of the many big lobby's you can find at newer hotels in Vegas.   Originally we had booked this hotel for three weeks, the full stay of our visit to Mumbai.  However the hotel is under renovation and although we had booked a month in advance, and their website stated the main pool would open the 1st of April; that date seem to continually change as it got closer to depart for our trip.  First it changed to the 15th and then to the 30th of April.  This was a deal breaker for us and decided to stay the JW only on the (two) weekends.  The first weekend we stayed 1 night, our status got us lounge access and supposedly an upgraded room (this was not the case).  The first room they tried to give us during our first visit was"
2884,"the perfect:  stayed multiple nights in feb for our indian component of our wedding reception; plush bed and towels and great shower and maid service; breakfast extravaganza in main lobby restaurant a must!!!! (worth every penny!) good coffee shop for snacks; beautiful lobby and grounds and beach and pools!! now the not so perfect:  as we arrived from U.S. late at night the reception staff was ill prepared to get us settled---a real fiasco when we were exhausted to argue and settle arrangements....esp for price we were paying!!! then nightclub bass-music kept us up at night...spa was very subpar for a JW (pedi was worst i ever had anywhere); asian fusion restaurant---skip as better eats outside hotel. all in all, not what we are used to from JW Marriotts....good memories---could"
2885,"Fabulous location right down on the beach front, great views and swimming pools.  Staff welcoming and caring.  Stayed 5 nights.  Rooms are not huge - so beware if your booking a twin room for 2 people - it could be cramped.  Bathroom was clean and spacious and bedroom had plenty of wardrobe and drawer space.  Food is incredible - with an absolutely astonishing range of dishes from their daily buffet - all freshly cooked and served in front of you.  This hotel is very popular with Bollywood stars - ""the beautiful people""! - so it has a charming glamorous twist.  Note that you cannot access the beach easily from the hotel due to security restrictions - so you need to walk around the outside - which is perfectly safe and accessible."
2886,"Spent 10 days at this hotel, it is spacious and you can easily get lost! It has many facilities and the location is great!"
2887,"We stayed here for a few nights in March 2011 and it is a great hotel, well appointed, rooms good, beds comfortable, great pool, no complaints. We asked for a late check out and that was not a problem except when we went to settle the bill. It was then we learned that we had been charged for the whole day. This happened us before in India so maybe its an Indian thing so ask before you assume."
2888,"The bad: The recently renovated rooms seem quite small and a little dark. My TV was not hung correctly and was crooked in the hole in the wall. The kettle/mini bar cupboard wouldn't stay shut and the light was unable to be switched off, so I had to put my bag against it to keep it closed. I dislike the design of the bathroom and having to walk through the toilet to get to the shower.   The noise insulation is terrible and I was regularly woken by other guests and staff having mobile phone conversations in the hallway. I was also next to the service elevator and storage rooms and the doors were noisy slamming shut.   The good: Buffet breakfast is always good with fresh juice and a wide variety of vege and non-vege items.  The room was clean and serviced regularly. The bed was"
2889,"a confused property tiny rooms, makes you feel you are staying at Ibis...chaotic check in...was there for an office conference. Conference facilities were good however food was repeatitive...  i would avoid staying here...especially with rude check in staff..."
2890,My last trip to India was quite an experience.  Our last day in India we spent the day/night in the Marriot Hotel.  The welcoming from the staff is outstanding.  The service is swift and the staff are all friendly and very helpful.  Just as all the people of India.  We were checked in within 20mins from driving into the hotel boom gates.     The rooms are very beautiful and clean.  The views from the rooms are unfortunately not amazing as we had a view of a construction site.  There is a gym and a nice pool to enjoy.  We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel even if it was only for one night.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is nice with decent service.  This is an ideal hotel for short stays within Mumbai.
2891,"Everything from the aiport pick up, to the checkin was seamless. Very well organised, and stright forward process. The porter standing waiting for a tip is not really what you expect however for this level hotel.  The rooms are very nice, good amenities, and layout. Really love the rain shower, and although I did not try, the large bath looks inviting.   Check out was also quick and seamless, with all my FF numbers captured automatically.  Breakfast is very goog, especially love the fresh juice bar.  The location is quite far from the airport, 40 mins, and the roads and traffic are not great in front of the hotel."
2892,"traffic is a nightmare outside and at first my family was annoyed with the smell of non vegetarian food in the lobby and we were planning to go to some other place, i wanted to register my annoyance to the management, i met lobby manager sudep sharma, he heard me patiently and apologized and suggested us to try some dinner options, very respectful and courteous, he askd us to try the indian restaurant and the evening was much better after that, we ate nice indian food (spicy but flavourful) the people were very nice and service was amazing, it was for the warmth of the staff wchic made our day, kudos to the staff in the hotel,i hope they will do something for the awful smell, rest all great, we will go there again next month (maybe not on a weekend) keep it up marriott"
2893,"Stayed at the Marriot with Family we had booked three rooms about 6 months prior to our stay.  The check in counters are the most chaotic .. two people man the desk ..and average wait times are about 20 mins .. the staff is confused about booking made in advance, they double charge you for in room dining or even breakfast ( which was meant to be free) .. it is no wonder you spend a lot of time at the front desk just ironing all this out .. the chaos truly kicks in once the staff rotates because the new guy behind the counter has no idea of what you discussed before his shift started .. and the story continues. The only saving grace is that the staff are courteous.   The hotel is well located if you want to be in the Mumbai suburbs .. it is overpriced for the facilities it offers"
2894,"This hotel is a nice hotel to stay in if you need to stay in Mumbai but is not 5 star quality. I recently stayed here for 6 nights and noted the following points:  Rooms - the room that I stayed in was very small but clean.   Beach - yes, this hotel has a beautiful setting, right at the beach. But, because it is Mumbai you cannot use the beach. I did attempt to walk on the beach once but was hassled by a child begging and had to go back to the hotel.   Photographs - the hotel has a very nice pool area but I was told by a member of staff that I could not take photographs for security reasons.   Car Hire - I wanted to see some of the city so I hired a car and driver through the hotel.  The driver was polite but brought me where he wanted to go, including two visits to shops"
2895,"JW Mariott is a landmark by itself. It is just located by the shore of the Arabian Sea. Overlooking the sea, it stands at an enviable location.  The value for money is debatable but it is an awesome experience. You may just want to grab a drink at the restaurants to grab the experience."
2896,Absolutely beautiful. Brilliant service and spotlessly clean. Great food with lots to choose from. Would definitely recommend the Chinese restaurant. Make sure you catch the sunset as you get an amazing view from the poolside. Not one thing to complain about. However make sure you go out and get a real taste of Mumbai.
2897,"Just got back from a 2 week trip to India, spent the last 4 nights of my trip in Mumbai staying at the JW Marriott. The hotel itself is very grand looking and all the staff are friendly and attentive. Room was large and spacious, with comfy beds and all the amenties you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The only downside, i found was the food, personally i feel the quality of food has dropped a level, since the last time i visited the hotel, which was 4 years ago. Besides this, we had a lovely time."
2898,the hotel is nice....the rooms are ok...but the service by the staff is no doubt flawless...restaurants are perfect with good service..hotel location is a great benefit...had a good time at the pool area.
2899,Obviously one of the more expensive options in Mumbai we treated ourselves to one night here in 2 months of budget back packing. So worth it. Blissful. Fantastic rooms with views of Juhu beach. Great facilities. Lots of food options. We left smiling and rejuvenated.
2900,"We have stayed 7 nights at the JW Marriott in Mumbai after a relaxing week in Goa. It was our 3rd stay in the hotel. The property remains impressive, being one of the best hotels in Mumbai. Location is great, spot on Juhu beach.   On the positives: impressive and well maintained property, excellent security, nice pool grounds, great gym, excellent breakfast.   However, with the increasing competition in the 5* hotels in Mumbai (e.g. Four Seasons), JW Marriott could improve on some elements in order to remain among the top hotels:   - standard rooms are very small and the not yet renovated rooms have moisty, dusty smell. So does the corridors that lead to the rooms due to worn out fitted carpets that spread an uncomfortable smell.  - turndown service was highly irregular, some"
2901,"I stayed there twice in February, 2012. Both times were excellent. Clean, comfortable and staff were friendly. Free internet was a bonus."
2902,"A great place to stay but you will pay for the luxury but it's well worth it. Food great, service great, pool fun... not a bad word to say. Just enjoy your stay here. You don't want to leave the hotel. The bed is so comfortable and the pillows wonderful. Have fun."
2903,"This is one of best hotel property in mumbai. the service is very good.  cost wise of course expensive as other 5 star hotel. Pl. check the tax %, (as every where the  tax as applicable.)  The only problem is traffic in the area in the evening time. thought the airport is only 3 km.to catch the flight ,you have start atleast 2 hrs before the scheduled time,othrwise you may miss the flight. (Specially evening time )"
2904,I loved our stay at this hotel.    Property is central - service is good. Breakfast just  great and offers a wide option of options.  We were given an upgrade to the next level of room and check-in process was smooth.  Would highly recommend this property.
2905,"Hotel is excellent, well located, rooms are very spacious, food is excellent. Only problem faced were staff not able to respond calls on time from room. Else staff were very courteous, they were able to locate my son's bag left at lobby even after 5 hours. Very helpful. always smiling. Hotel is centrally located and taxis are easily available outside hotel. It is close to  30 minutes drive from airport."
2906,"Neat and tidy hotel with a beautiful sea view ... nice reception, warm service a truly value for money hotel. Stayed only one night, but may choose for more in the future..Like to recommend for others..too"
2907,"Stayed at the Mariott for 2 nights on a business trip. Definately highly recommended for its excellent customer service, food outlets, spacious rooms and great location."
2908,"expect a long walk to your room, But you will be happy if you get one facing the courtyard and pool on the inside with a glimpse of the beah and sea. Sunsets are spectacular! The beach is not a place where you would spend your next beach holiday! The pool is nice and so is the area around it. It seemed that some rooms were still being refurbished. Excellent breakfast - one of the best I have seen laid out in a hotel."
2909,I work with a keading bollywood studio and JW Marriott is the first and only choice for all our promotional events and  star studded red carpet parties. The hotel is centrally located and makes it absolutely the best choice. The hotel also provides us with all kinds of set up for the events and a well trained staff for a smooth execution. They also have a great food menu and excellent quality food and alcohol.
2910,"Going by the iconic standards of J W Marriot hotels, this leaves a lot to be desired.  This is located adjacent to Juhu Beach, an area that is known more for celebrities taking early morning jogs, than business travellers.  There is almost nothing nearby.  Therefore, unless you plan to retire late in the day and leave early in the morning, this is a difficult choice.  The business districts of Nariman Point or Bandra Kurla Complex or Lower Parel et al, are too far and one has to be mindful of the traffic.  The rooms are fine, with decent amenities for the business traveller.   But slightly small. Breakfast spread is more for the Indian palate.  Ambience is a cross between an Oriental and a Western business hotel, neither going far enough to be memorable.  Service standards at"
2911,"this one seems to have lost its charm.. have been there umpteen number of times..was a great property when it started, even today, though the poolside and the views r unmatchable, the quality of food and service has gone down drastically. the standard of the crowd @ night club has also fallen to a new low. though the food n service is average, not what you expect from a 5 star. ensure you get a good room, coz some rooms r dingy. good business facilities though. however, i feel there r better options in the vicinity, like Novotel."
2912,My family and I stayed there in jan 4 to the 11th jan 2012 the hotel it self is amazing in the lobby is large and spacious there is live music all day. We had the club rooms they where very large and and roomy it has all the things you will need also the bedding used is exceptional also the club room was very nice for snacks however if you are going to be out all day the club is not needed ... The breakfast is a must it is one of the best in the worlds!!! Must do breakfast!... They have space for veg but beware u are told that the chicken is hallal however its not the location is amazing and the pool area is like no other. The service makes the. hotel world class the staff are supper friendly and will get you anything you need just by asking they are always smiling and trying to
2913,"I was really looking forward to my stay at the JW Marriott, I usually opt for the the Taj, ITC or Oberoi and I wish I had this time. Everything  about this hotel apart from the stunning views was disappointing and not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff and manager were not helpful or accomodating and the food (except at the restaurant spices) was bland, cold and poor quality. I travel regularly and have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world and I can say for sure that this was the most disappointing experience.  There were also renovation works going on all over the hotel and yet they failed to mention this at the time of booking so check in advance!"
2914,"This was my fourth trip to Mumbai in a year and my first time to stay at the JW.  I was disappointed.  The room was small, there was a bad smell in the corridor, what was in the room and what was on the fact sheet were quite different.  The safe was too small and I couldn't get my laptop into it.  The bed was very comfortable though.  My driver had real difficulty getting in to collect me and on-site parking was impossible.  The food in Saffron and Spices was excellent. The quality of the Lotus Cafe food was inconsistent and on the last day there was only a buffet on offer without any warning or alternative in place - the buffet is expensive.  When I complained staff resolved this satisfactorily.  The pool area is attractive but there was construction rubbish (bags, rubble etc.)"
2915,"Good location. Excellent view os the Juhu beach from most rooms. Excellent buffet breakfast. Very tastefully done decor. Good for all sorts of events - conferences; weddings; birthdays etc. Gym and spa are very good. Rooms are excellent. Just pray that there are no high profile parties during your stay, because Juhu is where most of Bollywood stars reside and they celebrate their special occassions at this property, on such days though you may have a good chance of spotting the gliteratti, the noise levels could also be very high."
2916,I have stayed in alot of 5-7 Star hotels and to keep it short and simple....   JW MARRIOTT Mumbai is by far one of the best hotels in the WORLD!!
2917,This large hotel is situated at the Ocean beach. It has great breakfast and dining facilities. The room are somewhat outdated and need refurbishment.
2918,"Prior to JWM opening, I always stayed at Taj, a major landmark of Mumbai for foreign Travelers. The growth in India have created hotel booms usually 4 star and 5 star ratings in key cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore,Chennai, Ahmadabad, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Goa and other key cities and tourist destinations. India is multiparty country of coexistence where rich and poor,animals and humans, Bullock cart and Mercedes Benz all provide a stark contract but shows a wonderful way of coexistence side by side.  Overlooking a Juhu beach, a still home of Bollywood stars, close to many shops and restaurants, this five star hotel offers international sumptuous breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets. The hotel provides various cuisines to accommodate all preferences.The security is very"
2919,"My first stay here. The hotel is excellent and what make the hotel great is the extra efforts by the staffs when you need help. I checked in to the hotel at 1am. As I need to scan some of my document for urgent email, the front desk manager on duty get his men to open the business centre and get the scanning done without charging me a single cent!  The breakfast buffet are fantasic have dosa, pharata and egg station for you to order! All freshly cooked for you! Plenty of choices in juice and pastry too!  The room I have is newly renovated and come with all I need for a business traveller. Just take a walk to the pool and across the gate, you will reach the famous JUHU beach of Mumbai. Awesome view facing the Arabian Sea!   This is a highly recommended hotel to stay for business"
2920,"After walking through the metal detector at the entrance to this hotel, we entered an incredible hotel.  The service was outstanding and the people were so very friendly.  They couldn't have made us feel more welcomed than they did.  Our room was very, very tastefully done and the views of the beach and sea couldn't have been improved.  Even though it was a schlep from the main attractions in Mumbai, it was worth the drive.  The pool area was gorgeous and watching the 1000's of people walking on the beach in the morning and afternoon was fascinating.  This hotel and our Mumbai Moments guide, Amish, were the highlights of our visit to Mumbai.  Amish was a true gem in our time in Mumbai.  If you go there, you must contact him and let him show you his city.  He's amazing."
2921,Recently stayed at this hotel whilst on a short business trip to Bombay. The hotel is fantastic and exactly what you would expect from a JW Marriott. The hotel staff are great and they sorted me out with hotel transfers and supplied a car to take me to and from my office at a very reasonable rate. The staff in the executive lounge are great.... even having difficult conversations with 4 or 5 guys who had taken advantage of the free drink a lttle too much! THe food too was fantastic in the exec lounge.
2922,"jw marriott hotel has a best location,everyone repeats their stay because it has everything what a niche segment traveller would look at, it has a best spa,a night club named Enigma which is a must visit on saturday night for party lovers playing bollywood & english sons as well,the rooms are luxurious,safe,"
2923,"Service at the hotel is exceptional. Rooms are a little on the small side but adequate and comfortable enough. The room decor is quite old fashioned, although I'm sure some people might say regal, and they could do with a revamp. The outdoor pools are really nice and the Spa is well worth a visit. Was nice but not overly impressed considering this is one of Mumbai's most expensive hotels."
2924,It is true that the location on the sea shore is excellent. The personnal in the lobby was not really  attentionated for check in/out. I asked for a non-smoking room but there was a smeell of cigarette in the room. The breakfast is not outstanding. It is a Marriott like any other Marriott around the world. The only good surprise was the invitation by the Chef to visit the Kitchen of the Indian Restaurant where the food and service was excellent.
2925,"Recently attended the RCI Shared Ownership conference in the Hotel. It was a great experience. The conference room layout, the food, the amenities, the cleanliness was excellent. They surely know how to delight conference delegates. Unlimited beverages, snacks, finger food, they had it all. The staff was very responsive to demands."
2926,"My reviews are normally short and crisp. However my recent stay at the JW Marriott Juhu deserved a more detailed review.  An English friend, who holidays in India at least twice a year, and is familiar with the top Hotels in the World, was recently at a Hotel in Scotland. Somewhat disappointed with the quality of service he told the General Manager that what they needed was ‚Äúa First world hotel with third world service standards‚Äù. It appears that the JW Marriott in Juhu has successfully become a First world Hotel but unfortunately with it also has graduated to first world service!  But first the pros‚Ä¶Great location with views and direct access on to Juhu beach. Well worth the extra bucks to take a room on the poolside with a view further on to the beach and sea beyond. The rooms"
2927,"Summary: We would not stay at this property again.  We've been staying at 4 and 5 star hotels throughout India over the last 4 weeks, so I have a pretty good idea of what an Indian 5 star property is. This isn't.  Room 1:                       - emergency overhead light stuck on ""on"". Ultimately, at 11:30 PM, engineering had to remove the fixture from the ceiling.                   - shower drain didn't work. Marble bathroom floors are deadly slippery when flooded.                   - air conditioning worked sometimes. This is a hot and humid climate.                   - internet was unusably slow (2+ minutes to load a page)                   - this was a new, recently renovated room  Room 2:                   - older, unrenovated room                   - internet unusably slow,"
2928,The opulence and service of this remarkable hotel is manifested in its delicious daily breakfast spread. The vibration machines in the celebrity-frequented gym are also wonderful. The marriott beds are oh-so-soft and cozy. The pool is clean. The entrance and lobby are breathtaking. The salon is affordable but nothing special when it comes to to mani/pedis - definitely just a random guy going through the standard steps. The location is nice with Juhu chowpatty right around the corner. The hotel is a destination in itself though.
2929,"We have been going to JW Marriott for many years and the same high standards have been maintained.  The Manager of the Executive Lounge was fantastic. We have travelled all over the world and the Executive Lounge at JW Marriott in Mumbai is our favorite, the staff are consistent and are ever watchful if your glass needs refilling.   The manager of the lounge even Chilled our red wine every evening as he knew that is how we liked it (he had briefed the staff about it as well).   Nothing was too much trouble for him.  They knew our names everytime we visited the lounge and the service they provided was excellent with a smile. Our 12 year old can get bored very quickly but the manager and staff were wonderful with him even during our six hour wait in the lounge for our 2 am flight."
2930,"Hi.. I visit this property quite frequently. Infact have taken the membership of Mariot Preferred It has been one of the most consistent expereince. Great location, rooms, lounge, pool and spa facilities I would advise to spend some extra bucks and get the executive lunge and breakfast included.. One of the best lounge services.. Only limitation is in the buffet spreat for veggie.. especially in the lounge.. but I will still recommend this property as one of the best in Mumbai"
2931,"we stayed here on the new years eve weekend .service was ok but  have to ask for everything the spa for he women was under renovation but nothing was mentioned when we booked the hotel in November .and staff told me its been going on for nearly one month .the room wasn't cleaned properly ,we did ask again to clean the room , so all in one all this just hiked up hotel  name & PRICE ,you may get good service other 4 star hotels"
2932,"Stayed here last few days of my holiday. Everything was very nice. Lobby, restaurants, bars, breakfast, and also went to Enigma club.  We booked a room on the executive floor and automatically gain access to the executive lounge. Here they served complimentary breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks, diner and free drinks. Because it was the last few days of holiday I stayed the most time in the hotel itself, it was very nice to enjoy all the luxury, helpful staff, superb rooms.  Just as you can aspect as in the most 5* hotel in Europe, personally I think that you get better service in this hotel and in India in general than elsewhere.   The swimming pool of JW Marriott Mumbai is amazing. The rooms where very spacious, clean and comfortable.   One major downside during my stay was"
2933,It was a wonderful experience. Nice place to stay and great food to eat.
2934,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels of this caliber, but never till now have I seen one allow the construction to continue until 10pm--you know, the kind where they hammer and beat on the concrete and it reverberabes through every room in the hotel.  I gave it a poor rating, because despite a lot of other good attributes, a restful night is the hallmark of a good hotel, and allowing hammering on the walls is automatically a ""poor"" in my book.  Let me add that this is common, as you will see if you follow some of my other reviews.  A lot of hotels still don't get-it, and think that they can pretend to care for  you and then abuse your peace and quite.  Thanks to TripAdvisor, we can now expose the frauds."
2935,"and I'm still thinking about how terrific my stay at the JW Marriott in Mumbai really was! This hotel has it all-- professional staff, outstanding accomodations, interesting views, and superb restaurants. It worked perfectly for a business woman traveling alone, who had to meet clients, and be comfortable, safe, and healthy. The fare is not inexpensive but the value is well beyond what one pays. An essential is access to the executive club. Staff and food there can't be beat!"
2936,"I had this feeling and it still continues till today....I get confused whether I am stepping into a hotel or a huge fortress, when i enter the JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai!! Just the view of the hotel building outside is enough to take your breath away, and this is just a start of things to come!! The black cobble stoned entry and exit pathways take you to the hotel entry point and what you will gasp at is the huge expanse of space that it is built on.       The clour theme that the hotel has been done up in is also just awesome....black, brown, cream, beige....very nice and earthy touch to it! Saunter past the reception and proceed to the main area encasing the restaurants, dining areas, meeting rooms, etc. and you will realise you haven't made a mistake by selceting this"
2937,"Mumbai is in no way shape or form elgant, but once you enter the JW you feel as if you've entered paradise lost. Exceptional hospitality and service."
2938,"Have just got back from another stay at the JW Marriott in Juhu: always great ambiance and better and better service. For the first time I have stayed in one of the renovated suites. While I mut say I felt a bit sad about leaving the old ambiance of the older ones, the new experience is just perfect. Nice dark wooden floorings, a lot of marbles, very delightful room experience. They are also ultimating a new restaurant and hopefully bringing back also the night club to its old fasts. Being right on the beach with the beautiful garden to walk and go to the pool, just gives a far lighter experience to your busy work days. It is also a good location in case you have several business meetings around Mumbai, as it is more or less halfway between all possible locations. Do remember"
2939,"I stayed in JW Marriott due to business,but stayed the weekend for pleasure as my family joined me before we flew for holidays together and I cannot say one bad word. The staff was extremely nice,helpful and polite(not always the case in India),the room(Juhu Ocean suite) was simply amazing. Huge,spacious,wonderful view and really high standard. The food,the ambience,the pool,all of it was really faultless. The kids pool and kids facilities were excellent. The gym was top class!  If you travel for business,it is really short drive to Mumbai Exhibition Centre and 30mins from the international airport(45 mins from local,but not between 11-12,30 when all schools are finishing and afternoon kids are arriving- it takes more like 1.5hrs).  The hotel drivers are really knowledgeable and"
2940,"i love to be in this property, staff, food, environment, view, every thing is amazing here. i go mumbai lot for my work and i stay in this property only. and i feel so good, after my work when ever i come back to my room i feel so relaxed as i can see ocean, waves very clearly from my room. what else to say its my favourite"
2941,"I stayed at the Marriott in Mumbai for the second time on the occasion of my cousin's wedding. I was sorry to see that the room was very poorly lit, the bathroom outdated and in need of renovation. The hotel staff were pleasant and service was good. Food was excellent and all of the restaurants are worth a try. Sadly I don't think I will be staying here again though I understand that the hotel is undergoing renovation.   Best,   Sahil"
2942,"I liked Mumbai after coming from my home town.  I have gone to all 5 star hotels and felt they were very good.  I went to south mumbai, had a good sight seeing and my family too enjoyed. We love mumbai very much.    Mumbai is good to settle down.  There are good townships being developed etc.  We love mumbai very much."
2943,"Brilliant place for an in-city weekend break! The rooms are plush, the service outstanding (they even have a DVD Library to choose from!)...but the highlight is the cuisine! Mezzo Mezzo was the Italian restaurant we went to and the food was absolutely bang on!"
2944,"my experience of the JW Marriot Hotel was something of a fantasy comming true.. its a palace ..  the service is excellent,, rooms are clean and tidy,, the staff is very cooperative and hospitable.. the food variety is also fantastic"
2945,"awesome view, great food, fab location though the rooms are ok. A bit unlike a posh 7star property in India. However the other things listed here more than make up for it. The swimming pool is a beauty. You can spend hours there and their spa is good too. The body massage is nice and the restaurants (most of which are open only at night) serve good food. you have a choice between indian, chinese and italian - all good"
2946,"it has the best location and service . If in Mumbai for business at the BKC end of town the Grand Hyatt is a far superior hotel.  If in Mumbai for leisure, either of the Tajs leave it for dead. The f&b at the hotel was great, especially the lotus cafe and spice restaurants but sadly..that is where it all ends."
2947,Good place ... near to Juhu which is a famous beach. Location is good and scenarry is good. Near by market is also good for shopping and roam-around. Place is nice with sea facing rooms... you will enjoy the stay and place.. Slightly costly but luxary..
2948,"Excepet the beach ...there is nothing really to write home about. The location is terrible..getting in and out of the hotel can be a nightmarish experience.  The f&b at the hotel was great, especially the lotus cafe and spice restaurants but sadly..that is where it all ends. The rooms need to be refurbished and showers in the rooms are quite dated.....and  walk to the room can be  quiet exhaustive if you end up at the end of corridor. For the kind of money they charge..I expected something better than this..."
2949,"The JWM is located right on the beach. ¬†That really is ¬†where the good news ends.  If in Mumbai for business at the BKC end of town the Grand Hyatt is a far superior hotel. ¬†If in Mumbai for leisure, either of the Tajs leave it for dead.  The JWM is a somewhat older style property where some rooms have been renovated and others not. ¬†Both have their drawbacks.  My first room was a renovated one. ¬†I walked in and went to hang my coat. ¬†No coat hangers. ¬†In fact no rail in the wardrobe to hang them on! ¬†I actually came back to the room in the afternoon to find a very confused hotel employee trying to find somewhere to hang my laundry. ¬†There wasn't anywhere. ¬†And because their was nowhere to hang things there was no bathrobe etc. ¬†Someone had just forgotten to put a hanging rod in"
2950,it has the best location and service . the food is also the best i would recommend the buffet break fast .its right on the beach and has a night club which was excellent in the past but now its a bit old and not up to the mark of jw marriot standards the rooms are also getting old they were renovating the rooms on one part of the hotel so hope next time i visit they have brand new rooms
2951,"It's a leisure time in here. The hotel located near the famous Juhu beach is one of the most happening place. The service is excellent along with the ambience. Near by tour is also very comfortable and beach at evening and early morning is an icing to the cake.  Not to miss out the midnight cafe in there, which is so live and happening that it never felt 3:00 AM as midnight...  Be there to share goodness...."
2952,"Outstanding hotel and service in nice location of mumbai.  A great ambience. The renovated room we had was so cleverly designed to give maximum space. Very modern, all the facilities you'd expect.   Marriott must train their staff extremely well since they were all so amiable.    Of particular note was Avijit Bahadur   one of the Assistant restaurant managers  We found him very knowledgeable  - discussing the food and its origins. He was so welcoming.  Also helped us with where to shop , was courteous and made sure well looked after."
2953,From start to finish I couldn't fault the hotel. I received a newly furnished premier room facing the sea and pool which was immaculate and stunning in design. I had access to the exec lounge where the breakfast was great and they also cook eggs for you. Service throughout was on the dollar everything they did not miss a thing fon topping up my wine glass to clearing my plate once I crossed my knife and fork. Would recommend this oasis anytime!
2954,"Strategically located in the heart of the central business hub of North Mumbai, Courtyard Mumbai International Airport is easily accessible from both of the Mumbai airports. Our Mumbai Airport hotel's spacious rooms, refreshing suites, contemporary & vibrant dining options, comfortable luxury bedding & functional work spaces offer the perfect blend of upscale amenities for business travelers. Our health center, swimming pool & sauna provide the perfect rejuvenation after a long day of meetings."
2955,This hotel felt huge as soon as you entered.  The lobby area and the dinning area downstairs are at a grand scale.  As a result reception area can seem very impersonal and you feel like one of many they are going to get through the process each hour.  Talking of size the bedrooms are not in keeping with the rest of the hotel.  The room was quite cramped and the bathroom was dated which surprised me.  That said it was comfortable for a short stay. The service in the main restaurant was brilliant .... they had time to chat and ask if we were fine.  The waiters fussed over our 8 year old which left us time to enjoy the food. They even gave her some chocolates when we left. The food was nice... and I use that word meaning it was not exceptional and neither was it disastorous.  We
2956,"This is my first time to India and there are so many images and impressions that just bombard you in Mumbai.  But pulling into the JW, you leave all that behind and walk into a calm, elegant hotel where the staff are clearly Marriott trained and everywhere you turn is a friendly helpful greeting from genuinely nice people.  I have an ocean view room that is quite nice with all the amenities one might expect.  Being jetlagged, I was most thankful that the curtains really block out the light: my first night here I slept hard until about noon, unaware that the sun was even up.  Free breakfast buffet appears to come with all rooms and you don't want to pass that up.  I ate everything they had that was non-western, enjoying Indian breakfast foods I never knew existed.  The staff and"
2957,"I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel through a friend and it was a memorable experience. The hotel layout is classic and the I loved the Indian restaurant. The view from the lobby of the pool and the juhu beach waters is breath taking, especially evenings make this an ideal place to sip a cup of coffee and savour the setting sun. The rooms are cozy and staff is friendly, overall a wonderful place to stay."
2958,The hotel is located not very far to the airport and has a huge property with bars pubs disc and many restaurant and huge property. The SPA is good and the rooms are well decorated but not so big The staff is good and service is nice
2959,"Located bang on the Juhu beach and pretty close to the ""bollywood"" hotspot as fas as resisdences of filmstars are concerned, JWM Hotel definitely has a locational advantage. Kebabs and tandoor dishes at the Saffron are must try. And in case you want to venture out, there is Mahesh Lunch home close by, Little Italy, Vie Lounge, and the choice never ends as you move towards Bandra or Lokhandwala.  The regular rooms may not seem that large with an attempt by the hotel to put mirrors on the wall to make the room appear more spacious that it they actually are. But then again, every body knows how expensive real estate is in Mumbai, and that too on a beach front location in Juhu.  Overall I prefer this hotel compared to the ones closer to the airport or way off at the souther tip of"
2960,Great experience and true to its class of 5v star rating. It was Centrally located in Mumbai which was the best part and very convenient. Although the traffic in Mumbai was frightening Lovely experience and enjoyed it thoroughly .
2961,It was an wonderful experience to stay in Mariott.The location is great. The swiming pool is really nice. However the best part is the buffet lunch over here. The lunch have varities of dishes across the world. Rooms are clean and well decorated. Security is a bit annoying over here. Other than that its really have a great experience to stay over here.
2962,"One of the best hotel in mumbai.Ideally located in the heart of mumbai. courteous staff, perfect ambience, very spacious lobby . Room service need to improves a bit. Best of restaurants and the Buffet lunch/dinner at their lotus cafe is one of the best in mumbai.Located in Juhu area of Mumbai on the beach. Ideal for Business as well as Tourist."
2963,"I stayed at this hotel on a reward points stay on our wedding anniversary. I had emailed the hotel ahead of time of the special occasion to request an upgrade. On checking in, they wished us as they had made a note on the check-in list. We were upgraded to a mini suite with an ocean view on a high floor. The view was awesome and we were treated royally. There is access to the beach. They help you with towels, look after your footwear when you go out to the public beach. The pool is awesome as well. We did not eat at the hotel, but the restaurants looked nice and there were a lot of people including celebrities. We saw the ex-cricketer Azhar at a restaurant.  Highly recommend this hotel."
2964,Had a conference at the hotel for threedays. The location and the in house arrangements satiates all the need for the stressful mind each evening. The atmosphere may ignite the writers mind for the best creation and also sends vibes for the reincarnation of new and fresh adorable thinking for the people...My stay made me to fall in love with the hotel ...My next visit will be more aligned to stay in the Hotel and not the business I have to go to Mumbai for....
2965,"Stayed for three nights and as with most international hotels, was not surprised to find the usual amenities. A selection of restaurants, Italian, Indian and Chinese, but I only eat at the buffet which had a good range and was generally good quality. My room was a little dated, but clean, and the bed was very comfy (shouldn't all beds in hotels be that way)! There is a big swimming pool that I never tried out, but looked very nice. One thing I really liked was the Sitar musician that was to be found in the lobby area in the mornings. The one thing that did irritate me was the extreme differences and erratic nature of the service. Everybody in the hotel was very friendly (as in all of India it seems), but on a number of occasions I needed something delivered to my room, which"
2966,"I stayed in this hotel many times during my business trips to Mumbai in the last few years. Please note that parts of the hotel are under renovation during the last two years and the hotel is suffering some disturbances. The location is good if you plan to work in the North West quarters of Mumbai. UPSIDE: A truly luxurious 5 star hotel with everything you would expect of a top tier Marriott hotel. Great service, very good dining options, nice spa. Very good club lounge with professional attentive staff and good breakfast and dinner. Very good bar, very nice dance club. Club rooms are small but well designed. Nice garden with access to Juhu beach. Club level guests get excellent airport transfer. Some rooms, especially in the center wing and upper floors (club floors) have nice"
2967,The property is located in the most attractive area of Mumbai. Its on sea side. the location is excellant with sea in front gives the property an added advantage and value. The restaurants (many different) are too good & its very tempting to go there daily.  Swimming pool is well maintained as expected in 5star property. The evenings are superb here. the beach is very busy with lots of Indian specilty (I can say Mumbai specialty) like Pav Bhaji/Pani poori etc can be tasted there.
2968,I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded because of non availability of the room that i had made a booking for so i immediately knew what kind of service i was in for. The coffee shop in this hotel is excellant offering huge variety of items. I was also impressed by the pool which is a little different from the conventional pools you would find at other hotels. The hotel is located at a walking distance from juhu beach so if you like to take a walk at the beach in mornings and evenings in the middle of one of the busiest cities of the world....this is the hotel to stay in!
2969,"spent 2 nights in an upgraded room and was very pleased with this hotel. The service is excellent, the executive lounge is top notch, the breakfast was amazing and the spa was perfect. Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to be helpful."
2970,"I had stayed in the hotel for a moth as part of my corporate relocation. The hotel is located close to the Beach but on a busy road. It had a big Ball Room to organize parties. The service is top grade. With unlimited breakfast options, they would even customize select dishes for you where you can talk directly to the Chef. Room service was prompt and the late night snacks are also good. Traffic outside the hotel can be a letdown but it is Mumbai afterall."
2971,"Whenever I have travelled to Mumbai, I could not think of any other hotel to stay but the Taj.  However, this time since majority of my work was close to Juhu area, I was booked at JW Marriott.  Although a bit hesitant, I had no option but to go with the recommendation of my travel desk knowing the Mumbai traffic situations.    I was delighted when I saw the complimentary pick up and was assured the same will happen at the time of my departure from the hotel.  I immensely enjoyed the smooth Mercedes ride to the Hotel.  No sooner I entered the hotel, I was very pleased with the interior of the hotel and the welcome drink at the reception gave a personal touch with well dressed reception staff.  I was offered a room that was facing the sea view, oh my God what a view, the view of"
2972,"Excellent! just excellent. SPA was just was so admiring. Best SPA I've ever been in entire Asia. Rooms were very decent with spontaneous facilities.Also, taxi facilities is very helpful. Staff was intelligent and very helpful for directions. Recommended for Mumbai Visitors"
2973,"The hotel has a beautiful pool I must admit however, extremely odd smell coming from ?? overpowered me.  Crows and pigeons everywhere, bathing in the pool, not very hygienic. Rooms are old.  The hotel has 4 restaurants and 1 deli.  I loved the Deli.  Italian restaurant is very good, all day dining is also good enough for in India.  Just, generally speaking, everything is spicy, not only Indian food but everything.  Seems indian cooks' sense of ""spicy, hot"" is numbed.  Never thought it is so expensive staying in a hotel in India."
2974,"I spent 2 nights in an upgraded room and was very pleased with this hotel.  The service is excellent, the executive lounge is top notch, the breakfast was amazing and the spa was perfect.  Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to be helpful.    Rashmi, in the executive lounge wrote down extensive details for our journey to Elephanta Caves including train names, distances, and important details without being asked.  A slight problem with our room was rectified by a speedy room change.  The front desk staff are excellent.  The breakfast was amazing and dinner at Saffron was excellent.  We had several hours after check out before our trip to the airport so we booked a 2.5 hour couples treatment in the spa.  The services were top notch and the couple's room was"
2975,"I have been to India numerous times, but this was the first time in a hotel in Mumbai. I have to say that I was very impressed with the service we received from check-in until we left.   Service: - Greeted each time we walked by any staff members. They were always willing to answer any questions or help in any way. - My 3 year old son was in the mood for ice cream at 8am (!!), but our waiter had found a way to get some ice cream for him even though they did not serve it in the mornings. He also made a ""kid's"" pancake especially for him when I ordered some for myself -- comped for both. - Forgot my passports in the safe on check-out. When rushing back from the airport, the concierge had my 3 passports with him as he was waiting by the entrance...I made my flight!  Rooms: -"
2976,"Magnificent hotel, great for any type of stay in Bombay, great facilities. Good location for shopping and night life. Great location to rub shoulders with bollywood stars."
2977,"This hotel offers a unique experience for all types of travellers. Business, family, honey mooners, you name it. Extra luxurious lobby with a fantastic view over the Juhu beach. Lobby buffet is the best in Mumbai and opens 24 hours. Only classy visitors are available at this place. Other restaurants are really amazing; Italian and Oriental. The food, service and ambience are really out of this world. Their italian restaurant has been rated the best in Mumbai for the last 3 years. With their newly refurbished rooms, it is the best accommodation you would like to have. Spa, gym and pool have great staff and well taken care of the equipment and space. The disco Enigma is one of the hottest spots in Mumbai. In brief; it's one of the best hotels and should not be missed by Mumbai"
2978,"Pool area was great and staff were very tentative however everything at the Marriot comes at a cost.   Rooms were cleansed but not all ammenities were replaced such as milk, shampoo, loo rolls.  Had high hopes for this hotel but was bitterly disappointed."
2979,"This is my third stay in this hotel and I enjoyed same good Marriott quality services. Nice room, not so big, but well furnished (nice mirror wall) and with all amenities I needed. Fantastic buffet restaurant (maybe the best buffet in Mumbai). Club Enigma is right place to spend some hours listening good music. You can enjoy a tonic early morning running along the beach too.  Only the check-in was a bit long."
2980,"Excellent service, great food and amazing ambience. Really had an experience of a lifetime. Have visited quite a few 5 star hotels in India and abroad, have found the JW experience really wonderful. Would surely recommend it to anyone making a trip to the city."
2981,"My special thanks to Unnati and Bjorn for letting us experience the wonderful hospitality at JW Marriott‚Ä¶.It was an experience of lifetime with amazing crew, excellent room service and the most enchanting view of the city‚Ä¶I for sure am going to recommend  any person who would like to be treated like a royalty to experience the stay at JW Marriott‚Ä¶   Loads of luck - Jasmin"
2982,"Amazing Hospitality and personal attention. Breakfast Buffet is truly international and you are really well taken care of, first time I have seen such variety of Vegeterian Bakery products witrh wonderful taste.Local fare & Indian food is delicious. restos bright and food brighter. some rooms recently upgraded/redone including the one I used. Poor quality of material & poor finish , some parts still not complete.layout & decor poor:  old ideas & styles.  Sea side blocked in the evening because of a party ........so no sea side walks ."
2983,"From the moment we walked into this Hotel, it oozed luxury. The bedrooms were supplied with everything you could need, the shampoo/conditioner etc were really really nice, the beds were to die for (I am going to look for a bed like it at home), the views were to die for. The restaurants in the hotel are not so over priced, we ordered room service, the fillet steak, tikka pizza and spring rolls (yes I know a weird combination!) but MY GOD didn't we enjoy them, the steak was beautiful, what they bring room service on was something we hadn't seen before! The view of Juhu beach, and the ability to watch the sun set on the beach with all the Indians & Tourists was what made our last day in India so special. The hotel has many famous guests stay, and this is something that made us"
2984,"Amazing customer service, some of the most helpful and polite people I have ever come across.  Stunning well maintained grounds.  Lovely swimming pool where you can swim under the stars!"
2985,"Wow! What a hotel! I had been there for meetings and minutes. It was a really good time I spent there with my colleagues. From reception to conference hall to pool, make you delight due to its modern and attractive looks. Staff is very courteous and helpful. I would say that staff is well trained and they know how to treat guest. Location of the hotel is absolutely perfect because airport is close from the hotel and Juhu beach is just behind the hotel. I will definitely visit this hotel again in future."
2986,"Amazing hotel. Excellent staff, service and ambiance. Amazing food!"
2987,"JW Marriot is been one of my favorite Hotels, i have experices the hospitality it was excellent, location and view was so soothing and relaxing. hotel rooms was comfortable and specious which includes living room and bedroom."
2988,"Large swanky Hotel backing on to the beach. Facilities are top drawer, lovely interesting swimming pool with panoramic view of the ocean, plenty of sun longers, huge dining areas and some of the best breakfsat, lunch and dinner buffets I have ever seen. The room I had was a bit ..well...angular is the only way I can descibe it with one whole wall mirrored and a little on the small side."
2989,I had a great time staying at this hotel. The hotel by far was my favorite to stay at in India! You can never go wrong with the JW. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and roomy. I didn't really need to leave the hotel for anything. You are also right on the beach. The beach however isn't pretty but the hotel makes up for it. I recommend you stay here if you're visiting Mumbai.
2990,"JW Marriot is been one of my favorite Hotels, i have experices the hospitality it was excellent, location and view was so soothing and relaxing. hotel rooms was comfortable and specious which includes living room and bedroom. Restaurant at the hotel having with wide range of food selection, other facilities at the hotel such as swimmingpool, Jaccuzi, Bar & night clubs were up to the standard. staff was friendly and easy to deal with."
2991,Very well located property. over all a very nice experience. acceptable distance from the airport. check was very well done. everything arranged and directly checked into the room with the normal reception formalities. they carried the signing documents with them and took the sign there. made one feel special for sure. gave me a good room over looking the ship which got stranded on the juhu beach right in front of the room. rooms are good but seem a little old and damp. service we good all thru. they have an amazing resturant for break fast and lunch/ dinner. very well laid out place on the sea front ( thou u dont see the sea from here ) have a very nice shopping centre. have a nice cafe and a very good bakery shop to go with it. there is Mont Blanc boutique for all pen loving
2992,It is one of the finest luxary hotel on Seaface on Mumbai suburb...almost all rooms are Seafacing. You wake fresh in the morning to start your day. It has one of the best optiosn of restaurants and bars. Also every night there is party as most of the Bollywood stars stays nearbye.
2993,"I have been to Bombay many times in the past four years and stayed at several hotels in various districts - the JW Marriott at Juhu Beach is by far the best. You are treated as a special visitor from the moment you step into the hotel's grand foyer, and that service carries through to the moment you leave. The breakfast buffet is spectacular - one of the best I've had anywhere in the world - and the hotel is nicely situated close to good shopping and of course it's right on the beach. It has a great Club Lounge facility; it's worth paying the extra money to use it. Overall I couldn't recommend this place highly enough."
2994,"This hotel provides and exceeds the service you would expect from JW Marriott. There is a big focus on the facilities here and the pool complex is spectacular - a sprawling flow of pools, streams and pavilions that stretch across what must be at least half a hectare. All of that frames Juhu beach in the background (from which the hotel is gated off from naturally).  The restaurants are very good, the service impressive and the rooms quite comfortable indeed (if a little small). The executive lounge has an impressive view and a decent spread of hot food that rotates throughout the day."
2995,"My wife & daughter had a 3 night stay, great location, great food but even better service !!from the moment they arrived till checkout. Had a tiring last day due to feeling under the weather. The manager heard and sent some fruit, then some soup, then some chocolate and even flowers all with smiles & good wishes from the staff. My ladies loved the attention. It really made up for feeling under the weather. Apparently we've got to go back as a couple!"
2996,"I am currently staying at the Marriott and will be here for another 2 nights ‚Äì I wish I wasn‚Äôt as I am most disappointed as I had booked a Club room with a king size bed (and my booking say King bed guaranteed) ocean facing as I had hopped to be able to see the Ganesh Chaturthi procession from my room and what I was first offered was a room with twin beds and when I questioned why I was getting twin rooms, after some discussions at reception I was told ( should I say fobbed off) I would get upgraded to a room which was better then I was going to get. What I ended getting was a poky twin Queen bed room with a partial view of the swimming pool and see where I could not see the Ganesh Chaturthi procession. I wish I had stayed at The Ramada up the road where the rooms are much"
2997,"We stayed for five nights and found this hotel lived up to expectations.The front desk were most helpful and, went out of their way to let us check in early. The room was very well serviced every day and the fruitbowl  kept full. The breakfast buffet was of  exceptional standard and the service outstanding. All the staff were very friendly and it was a delight to stay at this JW"
2998,"Experienced one of the finest venues to organize mid sized conferences. Excellent, attentive & obliging service on the big day. Great catering in terms of presentation quality & quantity. No other hotel provides comparable refreshments at tea breaks given similar price bands. Appreciated comfortable room & prompt seamless room service. Additional add-ons such as valet service, reassuring security screen for the event  & constantly well maintained wash room services much appreciated. Will definately look forward to & recommend JW Marriott for organizing future events."
2999,"My second business stay in this hotel. Newly refurbished first floor rooms a big improvement although a bit gloomy. Why did the lights all come on at 3.00am??? Nicely located on the beach with attractive gardens and outdoor pool. Staff attentive (probably over-attentive for some, but that's what it's like in India).  Buffet b'fast and dinner what you would expect with some being cooked to order.  Not a cheap hotel, but it is very good and has a good business centre with bookable meeting rooms, again not cheap."
